<br/>
<div style="text-align: justify;">During the early and mid 1950s, the
          U.S. grew increasingly apprehensive concerning the Soviet Union's
          development of advanced weapons including aircraft, air defense radar
          &amp; missile systems, and atomic bombs. The Berlin Airlift and Korean
          War increased the level of mistrust on both sides; however, the closed
          Soviet society made gathering intelligence about the development of
          new weapons very difficult and greatly concerned the US and its
          allies.<br/>
           <br/>
          In an effort to obtain information about weapons development and
          deployment, the USAF conducted regular routine reconnaissance missions
          near the Soviet land borders or just outside the 12-mile limit
          defining international waters. In most cases, the planes were
          forbidden to fly into Soviet airspace, but in a few cases the need for
          information outweighed the risk of overflight and a plane was sent
          into the Soviet Union.<br/>
<br/>
          One such flight occurred on 8 May 1954. The US Air Force had strong
          suspicions that the Soviets were getting ready to deploy a follow-on
          to the MiG-15 and needed to find out for sure. Additionally, the
          USAF's Strategic Air Command needed to know how many Soviet long-range
          bombers were stationed at the northern bases on and near the Kola
          Peninsula. As a result, a flight of three RB-47E reconnaissance planes
          took off from RAF Fairford in England. Two of the Stratojets flew as
          airborne spares and turned back before the overflight began; however,
          one plane penetrated Soviet airspace near Murmansk. The plane flew
          over numerous Soviet airfields and naval facilities conducting
          photographic reconnaissance and making radarscope images of the
          various facilities. The RB-47E continued to Arkhangelsk before turning
          west and heading back to England.<br/>
<br/>
          The USAF plane was intercepted by MiG fighters after being over Soviet
          territory for about 50 miles. Initially, MiG-15s were spotted, but a
          short time later a flight of MiG-17s appeared. The operational
          deployment of the MiG-17 was a significant surprise to the three men
          in the RB-47 and they knew they were in trouble since the new fighter
          was capable of reaching the RB-47 and attacking.<br/>
<br/>
          When the MiG-17s climbed to approximately the same altitude as the
          reconnaissance plane (38,000 feet) they opened fire. The Soviet
          fighters each made single shooting passes at the USAF plane. The RB-47
          was equipped with a tail gun controlled by the copilot and returned
          fire but did not hit any Soviet plane. One MiG was able to hit the
          Stratojet with several rounds and caused moderate damage to the wing
          and fuselage. <br/>
<br/>
          Before the MiGs were able to shoot down the USAF plane, it crossed the
          border into Finland and the MiGs broke off the attack. However, during
          the attack the RB-47's fuel tanks were hit and the plane nearly ran
          out of fuel before it was met by a 91st Air Refueling Squadron Boeing
          KC-97 tanker for in-flight refueling. The RB-47E landed safely in
          England a short time later.<br/>
<br/>
          When the reconnaissance data from the RB-47 was analyzed, it was
          determined that the Soviets did not have any long-range bombers
          stationed at its northern bases. The confirmation of the operational
          deployment of the MiG-17 was another significant outcome of the
          flight. The great need for reliable information on Soviet weapons
          development and deployment combined with the great risk of overflights
          of Soviet territory prompted President Eisenhower to propose the "Open
          Skies" treaty in mid-1955. President Eisenhower was concerned the
          overflights by military aircraft would be considered an act of war by
          the USSR and only approved a few flights. In 1956, after the Soviets
          rejected the "Open Skies" treaty proposal, the US Central Intelligence
          Agency created a secret reconnaissance program using the Lockheed U-2.
          The CIA conducted overflights of the Soviet Union into the early
          1960's when the U-2 flown by Francis Gary Powers was shot down in May
          1960.<br/>
<br/>
          Because the RB-47E was over Soviet territory, it was a spy flight and
          a legitimate military target. If the Soviets had shot the plane down,
          it would have created an international incident to the detriment of
          the United States. This was the situation when the CIA U-2 was shot
          down over Sverdlovsk on 1 May 1960.<br/>
