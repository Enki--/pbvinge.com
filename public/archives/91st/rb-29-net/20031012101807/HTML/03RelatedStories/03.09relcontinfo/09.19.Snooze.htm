<p><font color="#8b4513" size="4">Through one of our Lexington story pilots, Warren McLellan, we have<br/>
							received a presentation from the son of Lt. William E. Linn, TBF Avenger<br/>
							pilot, part of Torpedo Squadron 16 attached to the USS Lexington<br/>
							Aircraft Carrier from 2/43 to 7/44. His words have a ring of truth and<br/>
							timeliness relating to current events to a degree that I feel moved<br/>
							to share them with you on our RB-29.net web site.</font></p>

<p><font color="black" size="4">The following comments are dedicated to the memory of my father,<br/>
							Lt. William E. Linn, Avenger pilot with Torpedo Squadron 16 attached to<br/>
							the USS Lexington, WW II, and part of the “greatest generation.”<br/>
							My generation had awfully big shoes to fill, but this generation, well<br/>
							from what I've seen so far, they have some pretty big feet. Regardless<br/>
							of your politics or how you feel about this war, these young people, with<br/>
							the big feet, are putting their life on the line for all of us to continue to<br/>
							enjoy the freedoms we have all become accustomed to. Its tough to<br/>
							compare any generation to the “greatest,” but these young people<br/>
							come pretty darn close. Because of my generation wanting to catch<br/>
							a few more zzzz’s, this generation is asked to get up, smell the<br/>
							coffee and sacrifice for the rest of us. Bless them one and all. </font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">Before you read the story, I would like to have you meet my father<br/>
							as he strived to do his part during WW II.</font></p>

<p><font color="black" size="4">That's what we think we heard on the 11th of September 2001 and maybe it was, but I think it should have been "Get Out of Bed!" In fact, I think the alarm clock has been buzzing since 1979 and we have continued to hit the snooze button and roll over for a few more minutes of peaceful sleep since then.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">It was a cool fall day in November 1979, I had just recently got engaged, when over in the Middle East, in a country going through a religious and political upheaval, a group of Iranian students attacked and seized the American Embassy in Tehran. This seizure was an outright attack on American soil; it was an attack that held the world's most powerful country hostage and paralyzed a Presidency. The attack on this sovereign US embassy set the stage for the events to follow for the next 23 years.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">America was still reeling from the aftermath of the Vietnam experience and had a serious threat from the Soviet Union when then; President Carter had to do something. He chose to conduct a clandestine raid in the desert. The ill-fated mission ended in ruin, but stood as a symbol of America's inability to deal with terrorism. America's military had been decimated and downsized/right sized since the end of the Vietnam War. A poorly trained, poorly equipped and poorly organized military was called on to execute a complex mission that was doomed from the start.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">Shortly after the Tehran experience, Americans began to be kidnapped and killed throughout the Middle East. America could do little to protect her citizens living and working abroad. The attacks against US soil continued. </font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">In April of 1983 a large vehicle packed with high explosives was driven into the US Embassy compound in Beirut. When it explodes, it kills 63 people. The alarm went off again and America hit the Snooze Button once more. Then just six short months later a large truck heavily laden down with over 2500 pounds of TNT smashed through the main gate of the US Marine Corps headquarters in Beirut. 241 US servicemen are killed. America mourns her dead and hit the Snooze Button once more. Two months later in December 1983, another truck loaded with explosives is driven into the US Embassy in Kuwait, and America continues her slumber. The following year, in September 1984, another van was driven into the gates of the US Embassy in Beirut and America slept.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">Soon the terrorism spreads to Europe. In April 1985 a bomb explodes in a restaurant frequented by US soldiers in Madrid. Then in August a Volkswagen loaded with explosives is driven into the main gate of the US Air Force Base at Rhein-Main, 22 are killed and the Snooze Alarm is buzzing louder and louder as US soil is continually attacked. Fifty-nine days later a cruise ship, the Achille Lauro is hijacked and we watched as an American in a wheelchair is singled out of the passenger list and executed.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">The terrorists then shift their tactics to bombing civilian airliners when they bomb TWA Flight 840 in April of 1986 that killed 4 and the most tragic bombing, Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, killing 259. America wants to treat these terrorist acts as crimes; in fact we are still trying to bring these people to trial. These are acts of war. The Wake Up alarm is louder and louder.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">The terrorists decide to bring the fight to America. In January 1993, two CIA agents are shot and killed as they enter CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. The following month, February 1993, a group of terrorists are arrested after a rented van packed with explosives is driven into the underground parking garage of the World Trade Center in New York City. Six people are killed and over 1000 are injured. Still this is a crime and not an act of war? The Snooze alarm is depressed again.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">Then in November 1995 a car bomb explodes at a US military complex in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia killing seven service men and women. A few months later in June of 1996, another truck bomb explodes only 35 yards from the US military compound in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. It destroys the Khobar Towers, a US Air Force barracks, killing 19 and injuring over 500 servicemen.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">The terrorists are getting braver and smarter as they see that America does not respond decisively. They move to coordinate their attacks in a simultaneous attack on two US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. These attacks were planned with precision. They kill 224. America responds with cruise missile attacks and goes back to sleep. The USS Cole was docked in the port of Aden, Yemen for refueling on October 12, 2000, when a small craft pulled along side the ship and exploded killing 17 US Navy Sailors. Attacking a US War Ship is an act of war, but we sent the FBI to investigate the crime and went back to sleep.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">And of course you know the events of 11 September 2001. Most Americans think this was the first attack against US soil or in America. How wrong they are. America has been under a constant attack since 1979 and we chose to hit the snooze alarm and roll over and go back to sleep.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">In the news lately we have seen lots of finger pointing from every high official in government over what they knew and what they didn't know. But if you've read the papers and paid a little attention I think you can see exactly what they knew. You don't have to be in the FBI or CIA or on the National Security Council to see the pattern that has been developing since 1979. The President is absolutely correct when he says we are engaged in a war. I think we have been in a war for the past 23 years and it will continue until we as a people decide enough is enough.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">There can be no more Democrat vs. Republican, left/right, you're for, you're against, anti this or pro that. America has been attacked. It is as simple as that. We are all Americans and have to act accordingly. It would be nice if diplomacy or a sanction here or there would be the answer, but these terrorists only understand one kind of language. And so our military has to be brought into the equation. Doves and hawks must unite behind one banner, the banner of freedom.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">America has to "Get out of Bed" and act decisively now. America has changed forever. We have to be ready to pay the price and make the sacrifice to ensure our way of life continues. We cannot afford to hit the "Snooze Button" again and roll over and go back to sleep. We have to make the terrorists know that in the words of Admiral Yamamoto after the attack on Pearl Harbor "that all they have done is to awaken a sleeping giant." My father and his generation rose to the occasion then with the full support of the country behind them. It is time for a new generation to rise up and lead the way towards re-securing our freedom and bestow freedom to others in the world that have never had a taste of it. Unfortunately, there can be no peace until there is a clear victory. Godspeed to all who don the American uniform.<br/>
