						<div align="left">
							<p><font size="4" color="#8b4513">As I prepare to introduce you to Art Jones and some of his recorded stories, I am in the process of reading the book &#147;Saga of the Superfortress&#148; by Steve Birdsall for the second time. Steve&#146;s research has been exhaustive. He details the intimate events involving the history of the B-29 from its birth, the aircraft's, of necessity, premature introduction into the mainstream of combat training, to the injury and death of many of them, along with their combat crews involved, in the skies over Japan. His writings include tales of midair rammings by Japanese aircraft, stories of miraculous demonstrations of teamwork and bravery by B-29 crews in the process of getting their crew and aircraft back to a safe haven, come hell or high-water.</font></p>
							<p><font size="4" color="#8b4513">If you are familiar with a cross-section of our web site information, you already know that much of our story content is much less exciting and heroic than those related by Steve Birdsall. Each of the millions of our men and women who have served in the military have found their lives and perspectives changed and, usually, enhanced by their military service. These experiences have generated interesting stories that have lived on in the memory of the participant, but are seldom shared and preserved as lessons from life. To some extent, that has become one of the main themes and objectives of our web site &#151; <b>to record, preserve and share as many of these experiences as possible, before the passing time relegates their memory to the grave.</b></font></p>
							<p><font size="4" color="#8b4513">The stories of Art Jones came to my attention due to our common interests in B-29 related events and stories, as well as the interesting ways that human beings react to life experiences. Art has agreed to let me share some of his stories with you. The stories I have selected are short, often one-pagers. I have tried to order them sequentially to help keep them connected, where possible. I feel sure you will enjoy them, as have I, in preparation of this latest addition to our web site collection.</font></p>
							<p><font size="4" color="#8b4513">Permit me to introduce you to Art Jones</font></p>

						</center>
						<div align="left">
							<p><font size="4">Art Jones started life in Wakpala, SD on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. During his first five years he was raised the same as his Lakota brothers who comprised all the other boys in the small reservation community. He moved to Rapid City in 1929 where his father owned and operated a gasoline station and cabin camp located in &#147;The Gap&#148; just below &#147;Hangman's Rock&#148; of early frontier justice fame. </font></p>
							<p><font size="4">Educated in public and parochial schools and in his home, he eventually graduated from the S.D. School of Mines and Technology in 1949 with a degree in Electrical Engineering. Art didn't want to leave the Black Hills, so ne never pursued his life as an engineer.</font><br>

His education was interrupted by a three-and-a-half year tour as an electronic gunner on the B-29 Superfortress Bomber. During part of his time in the Air Force he worked for Paul Tibbets who dropped the &#147;A-bomb&#148;. It was Tibbets who was responsible for Art meeting his wife, now of nearly sixty years.</font>
						<p><font size="4">Art has dabbled in many &#147;ologys&#148; during a lifetime. These include, speleology (at one time, on contract with National Geographic), herpetology, etymology, chiropteraology (even having a pet Little Brown Bat named Teeny Bits - they were somewhat trainable), geology. Other activities included such as being a twenty two-year Scoutmaster incredibly proud of his &#147;Silver Beaver&#148; award, Chef in his own popular restaurant, State Senator, semiprofessional woodworker, Nationally Ranked Blackjack Tournament Player in Las Vegas, and TV news and weather broadcaster (the very first TV Weatherman west of the Missouri River in S.D.). All of this over a seventy five year period in Rapid City and Pierre, SD.<br>

It has been a special pleasure for me to have come to know, appreciate and enjoy Art as we, together, selected and published some of his stories which were a good match for our WW II-related collection. We extend our best wishes to his wife, Bette Jones, and their family members. Art was truly a bright light to all who knew him during his many public service-oriented activities over a full lifetime. May peace be with you, Art, and all those whom you have loved in life.</font></p>
