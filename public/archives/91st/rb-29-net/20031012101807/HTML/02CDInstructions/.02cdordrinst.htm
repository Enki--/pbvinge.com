<font size="5">RB-29.net Web Site CD Ordering Information</font></center>
<div align="left">
<p><font size="4">As described in our introductory information, this web site has evolved since its initial conception to encompass stories and related information from WW II, the Korean War and the early Cold War periods. My initial inspiration to begin this public service project was due to my feelings of lasting friendships and appreciation towards my own RB-29 crew members. Since then, our web site has expanded with the contributions of so many of you that I have come to know and admire. In this process, my perceived mission in this effort has become that of recording and preserving a wider range of relatively untold stories from this tumultuous time period. With my initial entry into the military, dating from the summer of 1943, I am very much a part of an age group of ex-military men and women who are fast fading into history. As our contributors see their illustrated stories on the internet, they too wish for ways that they can pass this information on down to children, grandchildren and friends within their circles of life. Many of you have communicated this wish to us in past months.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Realizing the unknowns involved in arranging for continuance of this web site when we have lost our capacity to do so, </font><font color="red" size="4">we have devised an option for those who are interested.</font><font size="4"> Our response is to offer individuals and families the opportunity to purchase one or more CD(s) that encompass the entire contents of the web site, as of the date of the recording. It is understood that we will continue to grow the web site, as seems appropriate, while we have the capacity to and choose to continue this work. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Up to this point, the investment of time and money in supporting development of this RB-29.net web site project has been strictly a public service. Our goal, and that of our contributors, has been to document, publish and share information of potential historical value. The economics involved in offering CDs for distribution requires that we charge enough per unit to make this service possible.<br/>
