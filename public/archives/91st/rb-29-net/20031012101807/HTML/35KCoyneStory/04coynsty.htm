On final approach, we were trying to find the runway, but each time we made a pass the ground fog would obscure our visibility and we would loose sight of the runway. After several passes and the flight engineer telling the A/C we did not have enough fuel for another go-around, the decision was made to ditch just off the shore. The shore looked good to me, but I had no desire to get my feet wet. The alarm bell sounded for ditching and at the last minute our passenger in the jump seat, our Operations Officer, Major Crawford, told the A/C to &#147;get out of that seat and let me take over.&#148; He said &#147;We will not lose this aircraft.&#148; <br>

Little did we know that this would be the last flight for aircraft &quot;Tondemoni,&quot; S.N.44-2237A. In the number one position for takeoff, we had a bad mag drop on # 4 engine. It was decided that it would burn off after warm up. We were on our take off run when # 4 began to smoke real bad. </font></td>

						<p><font size="4">The bailout alarm sounded. We had a passenger in the rear and he was the first to go out the right rear door. I was the second person to exit this door. The fire was coming back past the door and I had to wait to pull the D-ring until I had fallen through the fire. I wore a chest pack, as I was a tailgunner. I pulled the D-ring and my chute opened as it was supposed to. I was going head first and I did receive some neck burns due to the risers jerking me into an upright position. I made a swing out, feet first, and hit the ground almost immediately. The sky was lit up due to the fire and I narrowly missed some high voltage lines. Our passenger lit on one side of the wire, and myself on the other. He somehow got on a motorcycle and took off.<br>

The radar operator never got out, as far as I know. As far as I know, the A/C was the first out the front, followed by the Navigator, Bombarder, and then the Pilot. <br>

I had sprained or injured my legs, be we waded a stream and went as close as we could get to the aircraft. We came upon the others on our way to the fire. Our one time A/C was launch officer and he had seen the firry takeoff. Someone called for rescue and they arrived shortly after. I recall that I had a ride in a &#147;meat wagon&#148; and I told the driver to slow down going over the rice paddys or we would be in worse trouble. We were transported to the Yokota Hospital. They gave us a sedative and whiskey. Its a wonder any of us are still alive, considering our consumption of that mixture.</font><br>
