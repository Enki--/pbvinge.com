Two of our regular web site visitors were thoughtful enough to bring his work to our attention recently. With his full cooperation, we have assembled about two hundred and eighty pieces of his incredibly fine art works which represents the largest single display of his work on planet Earth. Please permit me to introduce you to this most unique and talented gentleman.</font>
<p><font color="#8b4513" size="4">Philip is a native Texan who began studying the oboe at age 13. While in high school, he was first oboist of the National Youth Symphony Orchestra at Interlochen, Michigan. He attended and graduated from Philadelphia's Curtis Institute of Music, studying under the first oboist of the Philadelphia Orchestra. He has been the first oboist of the Brazos Valley Symphony Orchestra (Texas) for 25 years. Guest performances have included recitals at the Morman Tabernacle in Salt Lake City and for President John Kennedy at the White House. </font></p>
<p><font color="#8b4513" size="4">He later graduated from Houston's Baylor College of Medicine, specializing in Internal Medicine at Methodist Hospital in Houston, and has been in private practice in College Station, Texas, since 1974. </font></p>
<p><font color="#8b4513" size="4">In the 80's and 90's he had several one-man shows of pencil drawings, and in the late 90's began drawing on the computer. These computer drawings have been done largely as a hobby, and to decorate his office and home. We have a picture of him performing with the orchestra and a selection of views taken in his office.</font><font size="4"> <a href="00.01.01IntAtch.htm">If you want a quick look, click here, and you will have an easy return to this page.</a></font></p>
<p><font color="#8b4513" size="4">His other interests include coin collecting (early U.S.), astronomy, weight training, music composition, and amateur radio operation (he holds the highest FCC license, the Amateur Extra Class License).</font></p>
<p><font color="#8b4513" size="4">In my efforts to bring his work to you, via the Internet, I have been absolutely blown away by his multiple talents and ability to render his subject matter. His sense of perspective, attention to detail and knowledge of the specific history involved, combine in his creation of images that fire up and grab the viewers attention and imagination so that “you are there” as a participant.<br/>

In an effort to categorize these works, I have chosen to break the total presentation into four categories: <b>Air</b>, <b>Sea</b>, <b>Land</b> and <b>Fantasy</b>. Because of the variety of backgrounds and interests of our viewers, I have made no attempt to embellish each piece of work with an inept and inadequate narrative. His works speak to each person in a way that depends upon their life experience and motivations.</font></td>
