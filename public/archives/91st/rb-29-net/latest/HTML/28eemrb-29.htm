We were accomplishing border surveillance flights both electronic and visual photography of sensitive areas with some overflights of targets of concern to the defense of the United States. Unfortunately our equipment, both aircraft, photo and electronic capabilities were antiquated and derelict. The RB-29s had been in the theater almost since the end of WW-II and suffered from extreme corrosion due to the salt air environment of the Pacific.<br/>

We were immediately reassigned to Yokota AB, Japan for our assigned mission of armed reccon over Korea. We did pre and post bomb damage assessment of dams, power plants, airfields, bridges and targets of military importance along the Yalu River and entirety of North Korea. Targets of opportunity from the ground up.to 30,000 ft. Targets included military convoys, trains, tank farms and moving tanks scurrying from the open area to cover.<br/>

Then we worked them over with everything we had while the fighters covered for us. Munition trains were prime targets and there was ample amounts of them. Raking a target of that type from the rear to the locomotives in front were especially inviting. Soldiers would be firing at us on board the trains with rifles and machine guns as we passed. When the steam engine was hit by 50 cal. armored piercing bullets they would penetrate all the way thru and it almost looked like Old Faithful erupting.</font> <font size="4">Of course when the munitions cars were hit it looked like a Fourth of July display that you've never seen.<br/>

In Wonsan and Hamhung Harbor's when Sampans were spotted and rather than to shoot them up we would blow them over by coming in at deck level and pull up just before passing over. They were loaded with munitions. That was ample and at least they would have a chance of survival.<br/>

Letter follows as best that I can read it after 50 years.<br/>

						Brooks and Frezza. Crew C-3, A/C #4000, Tiger Lill, Lt. Earle Ambrose, Prince, Stone, Womack, Welch, and names obliterated due to time.<br/>
<br/>
						The men of The 65th were the surprised and grateful men who received the gifts you dropped in our area Christmas Day. It would be hard to tell just how the men felt, what they thought when something so unusual as what you have done for them (obliterated) . To say thank you is putting it mildly, but it is hard to find the right words to say, "Thank You and God Bless You" is about the best I can think of and I do mean it. You wanted to know if anything was damaged, not a thing, not even a drop dripping. It was so round ,so firm, so fully packed.<br/>
<br/>
						You did a wonderful job all the way around. I'd say between 400-500 men received a share of your thoughtfulness and I say again, it was really appreciated. When the men saw the fifths coming out you would have thought all hell had broken loose. Every once in a while they would say " Why the Hell would anyone do that for us? They just couldn't understand.<br/>
<br/>
						I'll close now. It took me 2 days to write this much. If I was to write more it probably<br/>
						would take a week. Thank you and God Bless You again. Best of luck to all of you. M/Sgt Aloysius J. Graham, Co. A, 65th Engineer Battalion APO 25 .”<br/>
