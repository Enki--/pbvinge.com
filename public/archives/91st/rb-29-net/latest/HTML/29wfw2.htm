							Our crew returned to the States in late April, 1951 as the first to be rotated. We were scheduled to be assigned to the 5th Recon wing at Travis AFB CA. That was fine with me, my home-town was forty miles to the west, in Petaluma.<br>
							</font></center>
						<p><font size="4">When we got back from a thirty day leave in May we learned our orders had been changed to the 111th Recon Wing at Spokane, Washington.<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font size="4">When we got to Spokane, we learned several interesting things: 1) The Wing Commander, Col. Edward D. Edwards, had (as a LtCol) been the Squadron Commander of the 31st and 91st Recon. 2) The 111th had absolutely no airplanes. 3) The 111th was a Pennsylvania Air National Guard unit recently activated, and previously a Light Bomb Group equipped with B-26s. Their B-26s had been taken away and sent to Korea. 4) Col Edwards had learned that some of his old 91st crews were back and had them sent to Spokane.<br>

The four experienced crews would train the 111th as a recon wing. Each of the other three crews were assigned to different squadrons as lead/standboard crews and our crew was made Wing Standardization Board crew.</font>
						<p><font size="4">During the rest of 1951 we scrounged RB-29s from units that had converted to B-36s and trained the 111th National Guard crews in B-29s. We also got a few crews from the Randolph AFB Crew Training Center.<br>

This was the crew that ultimately was shot down in 1952. I knew all of them personally, we had trained them and flown with them. Maj. Busch, the A/C, was (I believe) from the PennANG. In fact I think he may have been the Operations Officer. Others, such as Msgt Homer had flown with us. Homer was our flight engineer for several months. I had known Danny Pillsbury, the photographer, on Okinawa. Pillsbury was in the 31st Recon when I got there in 1949 and he went back to the States for discharge shortly after. When the war started he re-enlisted and ended up at the 111th. As I recall, Danny volunteered to replace another photographer because he wanted to go back to the Far East. I have a feeling that Lt. Jim Scully had been in the 91st also, but my memory is a little hazy there. I believe that the majority of the crew had been with the PennANG.</font>
						<p><font size="4">I got discharged at Fairchild AFB (it had been named that while I was there) in Spokane in Feb. 1952. I went home to California, but after a month re-enlisted at Hamilton AFB. In late June of 1952, I got a letter from a friend in the 111th telling me about the crew that had been shot down. The friend mentioned that they had been flying 810, so I knew it was probably the Soviets that had done it. According to my friend, a search had been made and some empty life rafts spotted, but that was all.</font></p>
						<p><font size="4">Although I never went back on flying status, (Col Edwards tried to recruit me as a refueling boom operator at March AFB in 1957 (I passed on that). I was remotely involved in many &#147;Ferret&#148; flights in the years after. I spent twelve years in AF Security Service, ten years of it in Europe - England, Scotland, Germany, and Crete. I had access to classified reports concerning &#147;incidents&#148; and shoot-downs and was aware of some of the actions of the 91st Recon.</font></p>
						<div align="left">
							<p><font size="4">That&#146;s what I remember about those times. Although my memory may be a little hazy on some things, like people&#146;s names, the events are extremely clear.</font></p>
							<p><font size="4">As I sat here writing this, it suddenly occurred to me that it was fifty years ago - almost to the day - that I stood on the flight line at Johnson AFB and watched one of our planes circle the field at a low altitude. The two left engines had feathered props, and a huge V shaped chunk was torn out of the trailing edge of the left wing. &#147;They&#146;re going to bail the crew out,&#148; I thought. &#147;A B-29 won&#146;t fly with two engines out on one side. How the hell did they get it back?&#148; But then they made an approach and lowered the gear and flaps. As they neared the runway on final approach, I heard someone yell, &#147;Damn! They&#146;re gonna make it!&#148; No sooner had he said it, than the airplane seemed to stagger and then fell off on the left wing. In what seemed like slow motion it rolled about ninety degrees and hit the ground just off the end of the runway. A huge cloud of smoke erupted as crash crews raced to put out the fire. The entire front of the plane was rolled up in a ball, but the aft section of the fuselage had broken off just behind the wing and ridden up over the wreckage.<br>

							<p><font size="4">The area south of the 38th would be done by a detachment of the 3rd Photo Mapping Squadron, based at Clark AFB, Philippines. When the lone airplane arrived from the Philippines to help us, we couldn&#146;t believe it. A B-17 - Complete with an upper forward gun-turret, tail guns, and waist guns all in place. I doubt if there are that many people who know that at least one B-17 flew combat missions in Korea.<br>

We photographed rail yards, airfields, and other military targets. After a while, I think the Korean AA gunners got wise. They knew that over Pyongyang, for example, there would be an RB-29 coming over at around eleven-thirty in the morning, at 12,000 feet. Every day. The west coast run had the most AA, at Kimpo, Seoul, Pyongyang was especially bad, and on up to Sinanju. <br>

A photo-electric cell pointed out the bottom of the airplane picked up the flash when a bomb went off and tripped the camera.</font> <font size="4">The bomb had to go off at a precise location in relation to the airplane: one-third the altitude of the plane, and just out of the cone of coverage of the camera.

I think we probably scared the tofu out of lot of Japanese, blasting them with huge flashbulbs in the sky. We flew several night missions over Korea, and then no more.

A captain from Wright-Patterson flew with us to test the theory. The idea was, a photo would be taken of a target using single sheets of film. The film was then developed in an on-board darkbag holding the chemicals. Then, after a very quick drying of the film it was passed to the radio operator&#146;s position where a modified wire-photo machine had been set up. The film would be wrapped around the drum and transmitted back to wherever by radio instead of telephone line. The only trouble was, we had to use high frequency radio, VHF wouldn&#146;t carry far enough. And HF was subject to static, which caused very funny looking pictures to be produced. The captain disappeared, presumably back to Wright-Pat. And we didn&#146;t hear any more about it.</font>
