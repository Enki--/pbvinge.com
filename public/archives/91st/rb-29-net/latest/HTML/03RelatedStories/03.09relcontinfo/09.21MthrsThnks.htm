<div align="left">
<p><font color="black" size="4">I am a mother of two children.  My first is Scott,  seven years old, and the love of my life.  What pride I take in him although he will never know how deep in my heart he resides. My second child was born on September 11, 2001. That memorable day for all Americans. Leah, my beautiful baby girl,  chose to come into this world at  8:40 a.m. </font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">I went through the wonderful miracle of giving birth to an Angel - just as the world was about to change. So many things, as you can imagine, went through my mind that morning. I heard of the first plane crash into the World Trade Center just as I had given birth, and my precious Leah had arrived. I saw, in somewhat of a blur, the second plane. I saw the airplane in Pennsylvania (the state in which I reside) crash, again, with somewhat blurred vision. Let me relate that when I say blurred vision, it was because I was in the awe of watching my child's first moments here on this Earth. In these United States, In a moment of turmoil.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">My main concern on that day,  and for many to follow, was the safety of my children.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">Now, months later, I want only to give a message of many prayers and many Thank-you's.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">I hope the message I relate  will someday reach the eyes of those glorious soldiers who have given up their day to day lives with their parents, their spouses, their children, to fight for all of our parents, families and children.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">First and foremost, Thank you for risking your life for myself, my family, and my children, most of all. Thank you for putting your life on the line for everyone here in America.  Not only your family, but for my family as well.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">I pray, as many others do, that your motivations are swift and concise. That you may come back home, and that you will make us feel secure in our homes once again.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">I can't understand that anyone is against this fight. They must not have children, or such a love in their life to fight for a future. I can only pray for you, and pray for a future. If you have no one else in your life to fight for, fight for Leah. Born on a day of trauma for all Americans. She was brought into this world for a reason. I think she is a sign of hope. A future. I stand behind you to assure my children that future. As I am certain that so many of us throughout the world would agree.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">Bless all of "America's Best" Past, Present, and Future.</font></p>
<p><font color="black" size="4">You will always be honored in my eyes. </font></p>
