<p><font size="4">I think the vast differences in compensation between the victims of the September 11th casualty, and those who die serving the country in uniform, are profound. No one is really talking about it either because you just don't criticize anything having to do with September 11th.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Well, I just can't let the numbers pass by because it says something really disturbing about the entitlement mentality of this country.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">If you lost a family member in the September 11th attack, you're going to get an average of $1,185,000. The range is a minimum guarantee of $250,000, all the way up to $4.7 million.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">If you are a surviving family member of an American soldier killed in action, the first check you get is a $6,000 direct death benefit, half of which is taxable. Next, you get $1,750 for burial costs. If you are the surviving spouse, you get $833 a month until you remarry. And there's a payment of $211 per month for each child under 18. When the child hits 18, those payments come to a screeching halt.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Keep in mind that some of the people that are getting an average of $1.185 million up to $4.7 million are complaining that it's not enough.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">We also learned over the weekend that some of the victims from the Oklahoma City bombing have started an organization asking for the same deal that the September 11th families are getting. In addition to that, some of the families of those bombed in it! he embassies are now asking for compensation as well.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">You see where this is going, don't you?</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Folks, this is part and parcel of over fifty years of entitlement politics in this country. It's just really sad.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Every time when a pay raise comes up for the military they usually receive next to nothing of a raise. Now the green machine is in combat in the Middle East while their families have to survive on food stamps and live in low rent housing.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">However our own U.S. Congress just voted themselves a raise, and many of you don't know that they only have to be in Congress one-time to receive a pension that is more than $15,000 per month and most are now equal to be millionaires plus. They also do not receive Social Security on retirement because they didn't have to pay into the system. If some of the military people stay in for 20 years and get out as an E-7 you may receive a pension of $1,000 per month, and the very people who placed you in harms way receive a pension of $15,000 per month.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">I would like to see our elected officials pick up a weapon and join ranks before they start cutting out benefits and lowering pay for our sons and daughters who are now fighting.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">"When do we finally do something about this ??"</font></p>
<p><font size="4">If this doesn't seem fair to you, it is time to forward this to as many people as you can. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Now, you can wonder why does the worth of human life have to be discussed in dollars and cents (sense?) to put it in perspective. Am wondering if it is only in this country that it ALWAYS comes down to the almighty dollar before something's worth talking about...says lots about our value system...all numbers</font></p>
