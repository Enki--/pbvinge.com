<p><font size="4">John Roche's daughter Teri Roche reports than John died suddenly of a heart attack while visiting her in Homestead, Florida on Dec 1st, 2002. He was cremated and his remains placed with his wife's in Palms Woodland Cemetery, Naranja, Florida. He is survived by daughters Teri and Cheryl in Homestead and son Marty in Jackonsville, FL. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">John had served in World War II as a B-17 pilot and flew as an RB-50 co-pilot with the 55th SRW. His RB-50, with Stan O'Kelley as aircraft commander, was shot down by the Russians off-shore from Vladivostock on July 29,1953. John was the sole known survivor of that action, although the fate of some of the rest of the crewmembers has never been fully determined.<br/>

<p><font size="4">Roy Kaden just told me that George Brenner has passed away. Services are to be on the 24th at the Altamonte Presbyterian Church in Altamonte, Florida. Death must have been on the 20th or the 21st. I will send a card for us 91st people to the funeral home to be forwarded to his daughter Kimberly Randall and the family survivors. George was 86 years old. His wife Ardis preceeded, I just learned. For those who might not know, he was a Navigator while we were stationed at Howard AAB, CZ.

<br/>
							We lost another good friend. George R. Tarver had a heart attack Tuesday, 16 July, and died at a rest home in Nacogdoches TX. He would have been 74 on the 22nd. His daughter Terry Tarver called me last night. Unfortunately I didn't learn when the services were to be held or when. Been calling today to get that information and if I do, will let you know immediately. Also will send a card of sympathy from the 91st Recon to his home address for the family.<br/>
<br/>
							George was a special friend of mine and my wife Dolores. He was different, gutsy and very witty. He spoke his mind in a loud voice which sometimes surprised folks. It took a little time to get to know him as I did. George was a wonderful story teller and a loyal friend. I didn't remember him from the 91st when he first joined us at a reunion but am surely glad he came. He was only 19 years old when he served in Panama as a radio operator. George left the service after the 91st returned to the states and went to college to become a Geologist. As a civilian, he returned to the Panama area on a government contract to do a geological survey. George told me he had a wonderful wife for many years. As far as I know he has a daughter Terry who lives in Seattle, a son Charlie in Aspen, and one or maybe two more sons one of which is an MD. His wife died in the early '80s. And that is about all I know about George. There will be no public memorial service. The family will gather in Florida somtime later. Even though we lived miles apart, I am going to miss old George at the next reunion.<br/>

<br/>
							Ladies and Gents,<br/>
<br/>
							I regret to tell you that George T. (Ted) Hicks departed on his last flight in June of this year. He and his second wife Ellen lived in Myrtle Beach, SC. Ted attended our first 91st Reunion at Oceanside, California but none subsequently. I have been contacted by John Cudd, Ted's nephew and who as a ten year old visited Ted and Sue in Panama during the summer of 1947. John says he remembers the Finans, Brashears, Welch and the Coveys. He remembers also roaming about Panma City with Sue looking for the lottery ticket she had dreamed about the night before. Those were happy days, John<br/>
							says. I agree.<br/>
<br/>
							Everyone in the 91st liked Ted. He was our Squadron Executive Officer under George Finan the C. O.. I remember as a 2nd Lt, winning $25.00 from him. That much money was a wad in 1946. I was giving Major Ted a check ride or maybe a check out and demonstrating just how easy the B-17 was to land. I boasted it was so easy that I could make a three point landing using only elevator trim, rudder and throttles. Ted doubted it and so I offered the bet and he took it. With no gusty winds, it was no problem. Ted paid up good naturedly but I can't remember if he was smiling. Ted was a real friend to us all and we will surely miss him. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Grady Stapp and I first meet at McGuire AFB in the summer of 1948 when the 91st Strat Recon Wing was being formed. He was legend then with the 91st and still is to this day for me. Col. Tommy Steed (Terrible Tommy) SN 395A was the Wing Commander. Col. Ross Greening was the D.O. Ross was a renowned artist and some his work are displayed at the U.S. Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson. Besides that he was one<br/>
						heck of a nice guy. He was Doolittle raider and Medal of Honor recipient. Grady and myself was field checked out by Col. Greening in a B-25. I checked the both of them out in the RB-29. The RB-29 was equiped with new Curtis Wright fuel injected engines and Curtis Electric props. The latest and most updated ECM and cameras equipment available at that time. It is a great loss for a great man. Grady was tops. God rest his<br/>
