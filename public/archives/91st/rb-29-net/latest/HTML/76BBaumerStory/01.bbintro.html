<div align="left">
<p><font size="4">As many of you are well aware, the 91st Squadron recently had their Year 2002 Reunion in Savannah, GA. One of the highlights of that reunion was the presence of Bill &amp; Betty Baumer. Bill spoke to the gathering of his experiences of being shot down over North Korea as he served as a check pilot orienting a new reconnaissance crew to 91st Squadron combat operations. Reunion participants were moved and impressed by his presentation and delighted to learn that Bill had authored two books relating to his experiences. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">His first publication, </font><font color="maroon" size="4">“The Extended Mission of Stardust Four Zero,”</font><font size="4"> provides a minute-by minute, day-by-day account of the shoot-down, being captured and spirited into Communist China for an ordeal that would last about two and a half years. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">His second book is a fact-based novel that creates a story that will interest and please any reader; but, it is a must-read for any person who ever served at Yokota Air Base Japan and especially those who served with the 91st SRS. In all truth, I have never read a book in my entire life that drew me into a story so fully that I just could not put it down. The book’s title is </font><font color="maroon" size="4">“Far East Mosaic.”</font></p>

<p><font color="black" size="4">First, permit me to introduce Bill by quoting from “About the Author, Bill Baumer”. taken from the overleaf from his book </font><font color="maroon" size="4">Far East Mosaic</font><font color="black" size="4">.</font></p>
<p><font color="#8b4513" size="4">“During WW II the author instructed Pilots in B-17’s and B-29’s. Following separation, collage and a Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering, he returned to active duty early in the Korean War, and volunteered for assignment as a combat Aircraft Commander in RB-29’s, flying out of Japan. Promotion to rank of Major brought assignment as Squadron Operations Officer.</font></p>
<p><font color="#8b4513" size="4">Soon, he received a new Stateside assignment, but prior to leaving, he flew a combat mission on the night of January 12, 1953 as voluntary Instructor Pilot. The plane was shot down near the Yalu River. The crew was captured and imprisoned in China for two and a half years during which they were falsely ‘tried’ for acts of ‘espionage’, and were sentenced to terms ranging from four to ten years, depending upon rank. Two years after hostilities ceased, they were released. During the internment, the author spent eight months in a Chinese hospital, fourteen months in solitary confinement, and seven months with other crew members.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8b4513" size="4">The author had been wounded and suffered severe frostbite. After treatment at Walter Reed Army Hospital, he was medically retired from the Air Force in 1956, after which he counseled in secondary education, retiring again in 1983.”</font></p>
