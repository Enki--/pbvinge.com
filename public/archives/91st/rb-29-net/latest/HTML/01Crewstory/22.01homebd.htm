					<td width="272" height="1455" colspan="1" rowspan="14" valign="top" align="left" xpos="16" content csheight="1441"><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="4">As early summer set in, we were nearing our time to rotate back to the U.S. At the same time, the 98th Bomb Wing, a Yokota based organization that was a main participant in U.S. bombardment efforts in North Korea during the war, was preparing to rotate home. Our crew was notified that the 98th had a B-29 that they needed a crew for in order to complete their deliveries to the aircraft bone-yard (storage facility) at Tucson, Arizona. The paperwork was promptly prepared and we were soon introduced to our new squadron commander and the aircraft we were to bring home.</font>
						<p><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="4"><br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="4">Via the grapevine, we learned that our assigned B-29 had been a bit sick recently. It seems that a mixed cockpit flight crew had recently flown the aircraft. On takeoff, the A/C and pilot were not totally communicating and the pilot had cranked the turbo-superchargers to a high setting, overboosting all of the engines. We learned that, to date, two of the four damaged engines had failed and were changed. The other two engines were unknown quantities. </font></p>
						<p><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="4"><br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="4">Before being transferred to the 98th, our crewmembers had been given the choice to extend their tours with the 91st SRS, or rotate home. Our Navigator, Fred Brackbill, Photo Navigator, Bob Weisburn, and Scanner, Don Kleinkauf, elected to remain with the 91st and join another crew. The replaced crewmembers from that crew, joined our own for the flight home. At the same time, our Radar Operator, Paul Jackson, had a dilemma of a different kind.<a href="22.02p&amp;kstory.htm"> Click here,</a> to learn more on this subject.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="4"><br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="4">As we all began the packing up process, I found the most difficult parting, for me, was to give up my bike. It had been so useful during my assignment at Yokota, I found it hard to imagine life without it. In the end, it was sold as a practical solution to dealing with the issue. </font></p>
						<p><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="4"><br>
						</font><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="4"><br>
						We noted that the ground crews were giving our aircraft a good going over and also, they were filling the bomb-bays with 98th ground operational equipment. We suggested that the odds of our making it home with this somewhat questionable aircraft would be improved if we were not overloaded with woodpiles of chocks, etc. I don&#146;t think our concerns made a bit of difference. </font></p>
						<p><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="4"><br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="4">With good-byes said, especially to Fred, Bob and Don, we loaded up and departed Yokota for the last time, heading south, with Kwajalein Island our first destination. As we settled in for the trip, we found the engines behaving satisfactorily and we began to allow ourselves to entertain thoughts of home and the next chapter of our lives where we would no longer be an RB-29 crew.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="4"><br>
						<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="4">As we looked out at the expanse of sky, clouds and water, headed toward the South Pacific, the lack of need for survival suits to protect us from ice cold water seemed like a special gift. We each, in our own way, were giving thanks for a successful tour with the 91st SRS and now hoped for continued good fortune to bring our assigned B-29 back home, with all aboard safe and sound. <br>
