    "a": "Black Snow traces the path from Haywood S. “Possum” Hansell Jr.’s faltering high‑altitude B‑29 raids beginning November 24, 1944, to General Curtis LeMay’s radical redesign of tactics culminating in the Tokyo firestorm of March 9–10, 1945, and the subsequent burning of Japan’s cities through the summer of 1945. Drawing on crew diaries, Japanese survivor accounts, and command correspondence, Scott reconstructs the pressures from Hap Arnold and Lauris Norstad, the constraints of weather and jet stream, the vulnerabilities of Japanese wooden housing and home industries, and the step‑by‑step planning of the Meetinghouse raid. He follows the expansion of incendiary attacks to Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe, Yokohama, and dozens of secondary cities, the mounting U.S. losses, the collapse of Japanese civil society, and the political decisions that closed the war. The epilogue contrasts Hansell’s “scalpel” with LeMay’s “sledgehammer,” tallying 178 square miles burned across sixty‑six cities in 159 days and linking the campaign’s logic to the atomic endgame.",
