    "a": "- The Cold War\u2019s center of gravity was the Global South; the superpowers tested and enacted their ideologies there.\n- U.S. and Soviet projects were _modernizing_ and _universalist_, more about control and improvement than classical extraction, yet they reproduced imperial logics and violence.\n- Third World elites were not passive: they sought superpower patronage, pursued state\u2011building, and often fought their own peasantries in high\u2011modernist projects.\n- U.S. economic power (Bretton Woods, IMF/World Bank, market ideology) structured development paths and solidarities that fed both resistance and radicalization.",
