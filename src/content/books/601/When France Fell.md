## Reading Questions

- Why has the United States sometimes found itself aligned with unsavory or repressive regimes?
	- Realpolitik was the state's IR policy for a portion of US history.  This drove the US to make an agreements with anyone who supported our security dilemma, even if they were unsavory or Nazis.   

- What are the benefits—and costs—of doing so?
	- The US agreements led to lasting security improvements for the US, large parts of SEA, portions of the Middle East, and Africa.  The cost of ignoring human rights issues and dictators in all forms has left the US on questionable moral footing when addressing other countries about their poor decisions regarding the same. 

- Do ends always justify the means?
	- No, but some ends do justify the means.  As we saw through all of our readings, WWII was a unique case where, if total war had been required, it would have been justified.  

- What concepts have we studied in this course that might help explain the US choices?
	- The idea of the wrong analogy is strong in this book; the US chose to work with Vichy France in the same way they did with any other country, completely ignoring that it was a Nazi state because it didn't align with the picture of how states operate.  This also leads to perceptions and misperceptions, since the US continued to perceive Vichy as a free state until well after the war started.  

## Online Description

Shocked by the fall of France in 1940, panicked US leaders rushed to back the Vichy governmentÑa fateful decision that nearly destroyed the AngloÐAmerican alliance. According to US Secretary of War Henry Stimson, the Òmost shocking single eventÓ of World War II was not the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, but rather the fall of France in spring 1940. Michael Neiberg offers a dramatic history of the American responseÑa policy marked by panic and moral ineptitude, which placed the United States in league with fascism and nearly ruined the alliance with Britain. The successful Nazi invasion of France destabilized American plannersÕ strategic assumptions. At home, the result was huge increases in defense spending, the advent of peacetime military conscription, and domestic spying to weed out potential fifth columnists. Abroad, the United States decided to work with Vichy France despite its pro-Nazi tendencies. The USÐVichy partnership, intended to buy time and temper the flames of war in Europe, severely strained AngloÐAmerican relations. American leaders naively believed that they could woo men like Philippe Ptain, preventing France from becoming a formal German ally. The British, however, understood that Vichy was subservient to Nazi Germany and instead supported resistance figures such as Charles de Gaulle. After the war, the choice to back Vichy tainted USÐFrench relations for decades. Our collective memory of World War II as a period of American strength overlooks the desperation and faulty decision making that drove US policy from 1940 to 1943. Tracing the key diplomatic and strategic moves of these formative years, When France Fell gives us a more nuanced and complete understanding of the war and of the global position the United States would occupy afterward.

  

## 🔫 Author Background

Michael S. Neiberg is a prominent American historian specializing in 20th-century military history, particularly World Wars I and II. He holds a Ph.D. in history from Carnegie Mellon University and serves as the Chair of War Studies at the U.S. Army War College. Neiberg’s scholarship often focuses on the social and political dimensions of warfare, especially how nations and leaders respond to crises. His interest in writing _When France Fell_ was shaped by a recognition that France’s collapse in 1940 was underexamined in American strategic memory despite its profound impact on U.S. foreign policy. Drawing from extensive archival research and his expertise in transatlantic relations, Neiberg sought to illuminate how this overlooked moment reshaped the Anglo-American alliance and forced a strategic reckoning in Washington.

  

## 🔍 Author's Main Issue / Thesis

Neiberg aims to challenge the "heroic and triumphal stories" of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) by showing the complexities, fears, and Moral Compromises made by the Allies. He seeks to illuminate how the Fall of [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) served as a "watershed" for US Foreign Policy, pushing it towards Superpower Status and a more active Global Role. The book contributes to a broader understanding of Statecraft in rapidly changing environments and the enduring impact of Historical Memory, particularly regarding difficult national pasts like Vichy.
