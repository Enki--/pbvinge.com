# On War

## Online Description

The most authoritative and feature-rich edition of On War in English Carl von Clausewitz’s On War is the most significant attempt in Western history to understand war, both in its internal dynamics and as an instrument of policy. Since the work's first appearance in 1832, it has been read throughout the world, and has stimulated generations of soldiers, political leaders, and intellectuals. First published in 1976 and revised in 1984, Michael Howard and Peter Paret’s Princeton edition of Clausewitz’s classic work has itself achieved classic status and is widely regarded as the best translation and standard edition of On War in English. This feature-rich edition includes an essay by Paret on the genesis of Clausewitz’s book, an essay by Howard on Clausewitz’s influence, and an essay by Bernard Brodie on the continuing relevance of On War. In addition, Brodie provides a lengthy and detailed commentary on and guide to reading On War, and the edition also includes a comprehensive index.
  

## 🔫 Author Background
- Carl von Clausewitz was a Prussian general and military theorist shaped by the upheavals of the Napoleonic era. He began his military career as a child soldier during the Revolutionary Wars and later served in key campaigns, including the disastrous Prussian defeat at Jena-Auerstedt (1806), which deeply influenced his thinking on the failures of traditional military doctrine. He became closely associated with the Prussian reform movement and worked alongside figures like Gerhard von Scharnhorst, who encouraged a more intellectually rigorous approach to war. Clausewitz’s experiences in the wars against Napoleon, especially his time in Russian service during the 1812 campaign, reinforced his understanding of the unpredictable and political nature of conflict. He was also influenced by Enlightenment philosophy, especially Kant, which shaped his views on theory, reason, and the limits of knowledge. His writing of _On War_ was driven by a desire to create a systematic yet realistic theory that accounted for both the rational structure and the emotional, chaotic reality of war. Although unfinished at his death in 1831, the work reflects a lifetime of observation, historical study, and reflection on the dual nature of war as both policy and violence.

## 🔍 Author's Main Issue / Thesis
- War is not an autonomous act but a continuation of politics by other means.
- The essence of war lies in violence, but that violence is shaped and limited by political purpose, human psychology, and friction.
- Theories of war must balance the ideal of "absolute war" with the realities of "real war," where uncertainty, chance, and limited aims dominate.
- Military theory should not prescribe formulas but develop critical judgment and understanding rooted in historical experience.
- War must be studied as a dynamic interplay of rational planning and irrational forces—emotion, chance, and uncertainty.
- Strategic plans must always reflect the political objectives that give war its purpose and direction.
- The dual nature of war (limited vs. total) depends entirely on the political context and the will of the state waging it.

## 📗 Book I: On the Nature of War

### **Chapter 1: What is War?**

- War is a violent act of force intended to compel the enemy to do our will.
    
- It is not autonomous but an extension of politics by other means.
    
- War consists of a "paradoxical trinity": violence (people), chance (military), and reason (government).
    
- > "War is merely the continuation of policy by other means."
    
- > "Kind-hearted people might of course think there was some ingenious way to disarm or defeat an enemy without too much bloodshed... pleasant, but false."
    
- The logic of escalation makes absolute war a theoretical endpoint, but friction and policy prevent it in practice.
    

### **Chapter 2: Purpose and Means in War**

- War strives toward the extreme use of force, but political and practical considerations always limit this.
    
- War's aim is to disarm the enemy—but the means must be shaped by context.
    
- Introduces the idea that means and ends must be in constant balance.
    
- > "If the enemy is to be coerced, you must put him in a situation that is more oppressive to him than the sacrifice you demand."
    

### **Chapters 3–7: Military Genius, Danger, Effort, Friction, Intelligence**

- **Military genius** combines courage, intellect, and strength of character to make decisions amid chaos.
    
- War presents constant danger, requiring soldiers and leaders to master fear and act decisively.
    
- **Friction** describes the fog, confusion, and unpredictability inherent in real war.
    
- > "Everything in war is very simple, but the simplest thing is difficult."
    
- Commanders must operate with incomplete and unreliable intelligence, relying on judgment and instinct.
    

### **Chapter 8: Concluding Observations**

- War is a dynamic interaction of violence, chance, and rational purpose.
    
- Moral factors (willpower, leadership, public support) are as decisive as physical ones.
    
- Political aims define the shape and limits of military action.
    
- > "War is not an exercise of the will directed at inanimate matter... it is always directed at an animate object that reacts."

## 📙 Book II: On the Theory of War

### **Chapter 1: Classifications of the Art of War**

- Categorizes war by objective: war of observation, limited war, and total war.
    
- Draws attention to how different types of war require different theories and approaches.
    
- Recognizes the need for conceptual clarity to inform practical decision-making.
    

### **Chapter 2: On the Theory of War**

- Theory must avoid rigid systems; it should educate judgment and be grounded in experience.
    
- Critiques the notion of war as a science—too many variables, too much human complexity.
    
- > "Theory must never conflict with reality."
    
- Introduces the concept of "critical analysis" as the heart of military thinking—not calculation but reflective interpretation.
    

### **Chapter 3: Art or Science of War**

- War is not a pure science; it involves art, instinct, and adaptation.
    
- The uniqueness of each conflict resists formulaic solutions.
    
- > "Theory becomes experience."
    

### **Chapters 4–6: Method, Routine, Critical Analysis**

- Mechanical adherence to routine undermines effective strategy.
    
- Emphasizes the dangers of military pedantry and blind tradition.
    
- Encourages officers to learn through analysis and critical reflection, not just repetition.

## 📙 Book III

### Chapter One: Strategy

• Summary: Strategy is fundamentally defined as the use of engagements for the overall purpose of the war. It involves careful planning and understanding of both the material and intellectual factors that determine the course of military actions. Unlike tactics, strategy operates in a realm where much has to be guessed, and conviction is weaker, demanding exceptional strength of character, lucidity, and firmness of mind from a general to consistently pursue objectives despite uncertainties.

> "The general concept of strategy was defined in the second chapter of Book Two. It is the use of an engagement for the purpose of the war" (Clausewitz, p. 177).

> "In a tactical situation one is able to see at least half the problem with the naked eye, whereas in strategy everything has to be guessed and presumed. Conviction is therefore weaker. Consequently most generals, when they ought to act, are paralyzed by unnecessary doubts" (Clausewitz, p. 177).

### Chapter Two: Elements of Strategy

• Summary: This chapter categorizes the diverse elements affecting strategic engagements into moral, physical, mathematical, geographical, and statistical factors. Clausewitz stresses that these elements are not isolated but interconnected in intricate ways within each military action, and therefore, analyzing them in isolation would be detrimental to understanding strategy properly.

> "The strategic elements that affect the use of engagements may be classified into various types: moral, physical, mathematical, geographical, and statistical" (Clausewitz, p. 182).

> "It would however be disastrous to try to develop our understanding of strategy by analyzing these factors in isolation, since they are usually interconnected in each military action in manifold and intricate ways" (Clausewitz, p. 182).

### Chapter Three: Moral Factors

• Summary: Moral elements are underscored as critically important in war, constituting the pervasive "spirit" that influences the entire conflict and merges with the will of the commander. While intangible and difficult to quantify, their often "incredible effect" is proven by history, demonstrating their decisive impact on the physical aspects of warfare and emphasizing the need for theory to account for them rather than dismissing them as exceptions.

> "We must return once more to this subject...since the moral elements are among the most important in war. They constitute the spirit that permeates war as a whole, and at an early stage they establish a close affinity with the will that moves and leads the whole mass of force, practically merging with it, since the will is itself a moral quantity" (Clausewitz, p. 183).

> "History provides the strongest proof of the importance of moral factors and their often incredible effect: this is the noblest and most solid nourishment that the mind of a general may draw from a study of the past" (Clausewitz, p. 184).

### Chapter Four: The Principal Moral Elements

• Summary: This chapter aims to identify and describe the primary moral characteristics crucial for military success. While acknowledging that a comprehensive listing might lead to truisms, Clausewitz indirectly highlights qualities like courage, resolve, and character as indispensable. He emphasizes that the effectiveness of these moral factors, while not precisely quantifiable, can be "estimated," implying they are measurable in their influence on the overall conduct of war.

> "We might list the most important moral phenomena in war and, like a diligent professor, try to evaluate them one by one. This method, however, all too easily leads to platitudes, while the genuine spirit of inquiry soon evaporates, and unwittingly we find ourselves proclaiming what everybody already knows" (Clausewitz, p. 185).

> "The spirit of an army may be envisaged as a definite moral factor that can be mentally subtracted, whose influence may therefore be estimated—in other words, it is a tool whose power is measurable" (Clausewitz, p. 188).

### Chapter Five: Military Virtues of the Army

• Summary: Military virtues are presented as distinct from simple bravery, arising from an individual's deep immersion in military activity, encompassing training, intelligence, practice, and a full dedication of personality. An army's efficiency is enhanced by enthusiasm, but it is this deeper "military spirit," forged through experience and exertion, that allows an army to endure and achieve outstanding successes even in adversity.

> "An army’s military qualities are based on the individual who is steeped in the spirit and essence of this activity; who trains the capacities it demands, rouses them, and makes them his own; who applies his intelligence to every detail; who gains ease and confidence through practice, and who completely immerses his personality in the appointed task" (Clausewitz, p. 187).

> "One would have to be blind to all the evidence of history if one refused to admit that the outstanding successes of these commanders and their greatness in adversity were feasible only with the aid of an army possessing these virtues" (Clausewitz, p. 189).

### Chapter Six: Boldness

• Summary: Boldness is viewed as an essential quality in warfare, particularly in the lower ranks. However, for commanders, it must be "disciplined by reflection" and guided by a superior intellect, avoiding actions that crudely defy the laws of probability. Clausewitz emphasizes that timidity is far more detrimental in war than audacity, making boldness, when properly applied, a fundamental prerequisite for great military leadership.

> "Given the same amount of intelligence, timidity will do a thousand times more damage in war than audacity. The truth of this observation will be self-evident to our readers" (Clausewitz, p. 190).

> "Boldness governed by superior intellect is the mark of a hero. This kind of boldness does not consist in defying the natural order of things and in crudely offending the laws of probability" (Clausewitz, p. 191).

### Chapter Seven: Perseverance

• Summary: Perseverance is highlighted as the indispensable counterweight to the inherent unpredictability and difficulties of war. Given that military operations demand "infinite effort, trouble, and privation," and that human beings are prone to weakness under pressure, strong willpower and steadfastness are crucial for a commander to overcome obstacles, achieve objectives, and earn lasting admiration.

> "In war more than anywhere else things do not turn out as we expect. Nearby they do not appear as they did from a distance" (Clausewitz, p. 192).

> "there is hardly a worthwhile enterprise in war whose execution does not call for infinite effort, trouble, and privation; and as man under pressure tends to give in to physical and intellectual weakness, only great strength of will can lead to the objective. It is steadfastness that will earn the admiration of the world and of posterity" (Clausewitz, p. 193).

### Chapter Eight: Superiority of Numbers

• Summary: Superiority of numbers is identified as the most common and significant factor in achieving victory, both tactically and strategically. While talented commanders can sometimes overcome numerical inferiority, there are limits, especially among comparable armies. Thus, Clausewitz concludes that in ordinary circumstances, a significant numerical advantage will typically assure victory, making the fielding of the largest possible army a primary strategic objective.

> "In tactics, as in strategy, superiority of numbers is the most common element in victory" (Clausewitz, p. 194).

> "even the most talented of commanders will find it difficult to defeat an opponent twice his strength...a significant superiority of numbers... will suffice to assure victory, however adverse the other circumstances" (Clausewitz, p. 195).

### Chapter Nine: Surprise

• Summary: Surprise is a universally desired means to gain superiority and demoralize the enemy, but Clausewitz cautions that it is often harder to achieve in practice than assumed, due to the "friction of the whole machine" and the role of chance. Its success depends on the commander's ability to impose his will and execute plans correctly, as faulty measures can lead to negative outcomes.

> "This desire is more or less basic to all operations, for without it superiority at the decisive point is hardly conceivable" (Clausewitz, p. 199).

> "Only the commander who imposes his will can take the enemy by surprise; and in order to impose his will, he must act correctly. If we surprise the enemy with faulty measures, we may not benefit at all, but instead suffer sharp reverses" (Clausewitz, p. 200).

### Chapter Ten: Cunning

• Summary: Clausewitz expresses a skeptical view of strategic cunning and stratagems, noting that they rarely feature prominently in military history. He argues that effective deception usually requires deploying substantial forces, which carries the risk of wasting valuable troops that may be needed for decisive action elsewhere, making such diversions generally impractical and dangerous over extended periods.

> "Yet however much one longs to see opposing generals vie with one another in craft, cleverness, and cunning, the fact remains that these qualities do not figure prominently in the history of war" (Clausewitz, p. 201).

> "it is dangerous . . . to use substantial forces over any length of time merely to create an illusion; there is always the risk that nothing will be gained, and that the troops deployed will not be available when they are really needed" (Clausewitz, p. 202).

### Chapter Eleven: Concentration of Forces in Space

• Summary: Clausewitz declares the concentration of forces to be a fundamental and simple law of strategy: "always to be very strong; first in general, and then at the decisive point." This principle means avoiding unnecessary detachment of forces from the main body, ensuring that strength is maximized at the critical junctures of the conflict.

> "The best strategy is always to be very strong; first in general, and then at the decisive point" (Clausewitz, p. 204).

> "No force should ever be detached from the main body unless the need is definite and urgent. We hold fast to this principle, and regard it as a reliable guide" (Clausewitz, p. 204).

### Chapter Twelve: Unification of Forces in Time

• Summary: War is a direct clash of opposing forces, implying that all available means for a given action should be employed simultaneously to achieve decisive impact. While strategy must account for successive efforts and sustained effects, particularly in the continuous deployment of new forces, the immediate nature of combat necessitates the combined use of force. This ensures that the stronger force not only destroys the weaker but carries its momentum forward effectively.

> "the simultaneous use of all means intended for a given action appears as an elementary law of war" (Clausewitz, p. 205).

> "since obviously greater force is more likely to lead to success, it naturally follows that we can never use too great a force, and further, that all available force must be used simultaneously" (Clausewitz, p. 206).

### Chapter Thirteen: The Strategic Reserve

• Summary: This chapter discusses the role and proper use of a strategic reserve. While reserves can be beneficial in unforeseen emergencies, the primary emphasis is on ensuring all parts of an army are actively engaged when the opportunity for action arises. Inactive troops are considered neutralized, underscoring that the effectiveness of a reserve is dependent on the context of the overall battle and the dynamic needs of the situation.

> "The danger, however, applies only to the phase of confusion, the condi-tion of disarray and weakness—in brief, the crisis that occurs in every engagement, even on the victorious side. In the context of such a weakened condition, the appearance of relatively fresh troops will be decisive" (Clausewitz, p. 208).

> "When the time for action comes, the first requirement should be that all parts must act: even the least appropriate task will occupy some of the enemy’s forces and reduce his overall strength, while completely inactive troops are neutralized for the time being" (Clausewitz, p. 213).

### Chapter Fourteen: Economy of Force

• Summary: This chapter emphasizes that the "principle of economy of force" means the effective and full utilization of all available forces, rather than a miserly or minimal deployment. Clausewitz argues that forces not engaged with the enemy are wasted, and even those used inappropriately are better than idle, as they at least occupy enemy attention and reduce his overall strength.

> "The 'principle of economy of force,' treated at some length by Jomini, has continued to appear in the standard lists of principles down to the present day" (Brodie, citing Clausewitz, p. 665).

> "In war, Clausewitz says, one must 'make sure that all forces are involved . . . that no part of the whole force is idle.' Forces which are not busy with the enemy 'are being wasted, which is even worse than using them inappropriately,' for forces which are used inappropriately are at least occupying some of the enemy forces and reducing his overall strength" (Brodie, citing Clausewitz, p. 665).

### Chapter Fifteen: The Geometrical Factor

• Summary: Clausewitz largely dismisses the notion of applying geometrical principles to strategy, viewing it as a "vagary" that offers little practical utility. While acknowledging some limited relevance to tactics, he asserts that the complexities and uncertainties of war render such mathematical approaches ineffective in grand strategy, and a sound theory of war should expose their spurious claims.

> "The brief chapter, 'The Geometrical Factor,' is little more than a rejection of the notions of von Bülow, who wanted to make strategy 'more scientific' by discussing it in terms of geometry" (Brodie, citing Clausewitz, p. 665).

> "Clausewitz allows that it may have some relevance to tactics but virtually none to strategy. 'We believe,' he says, 'that it is one of the chief functions of a comprehensive theory of war to expose such vagaries.'" (Brodie, citing Clausewitz, p. 666).

### Chapter Sixteen: The Suspension of Action in War

• Summary: This chapter explores why war, despite its inherent drive towards a decisive goal, is frequently characterized by periods of inactivity. Clausewitz attributes this not only to human frailty and indecision but also to the inherent strength of the defensive. He contrasts the often "half-hearted" wars of the past with the energetic "absolute war" exemplified by Napoleon, asserting that what is possible in warfare becomes necessary, and a failure to exert full energy is a grave error.

> "The history of warfare so often shows us the very opposite of unceasing progress toward the goal, that it becomes apparent that immobility and inactivity are the normal state of armies in war, and action is the exception" (Clausewitz, p. 216).

> "Woe to the government, which, relying on half-hearted politics and a shackled military policy, meets a foe who, like the untamed elements, knows no law other than his own power!” (Brodie, citing Clausewitz, p. 667).

### Chapter Seventeen: The Character of Contemporary Warfare

• Summary: This chapter emphasizes the importance of understanding the distinctive character of contemporary warfare for strategic planning. Clausewitz notes that modern warfare, particularly since the French Revolution, has been waged with significantly greater energy and speed, moving closer to its "absolute" form. This means that forces now press unremittingly towards great decisions, and traditional periods of rest have diminished.

> "All planning, particularly strategic planning, must pay attention to the character of contemporary warfare" (Clausewitz, p. 219).

> "Even though modern war is of a totally different character, as has been pointed out in the preceding chapter, it remains true that periods of active warfare will always be interspersed with greater or smaller periods of rest" (Clausewitz, p. 220).

### Chapter Eighteen: Tension and Rest

• Summary: This chapter describes the dynamic interplay of tension and rest as a fundamental law in war. Clausewitz asserts that "the state of crisis," or periods of heightened tension, constitute the "real war," where actions have greater significance and results. Equilibrium, by contrast, is merely a reflex. This highlights the critical importance of a commander's ability to operate effectively during and exploit moments of intense tension.

> "Even though modern war is of a totally different character... it remains true that periods of active warfare will always be interspersed with greater or smaller periods of rest" (Clausewitz, p. 220).

> "Any move made in a state of tension will be more important, and will have more results, than it would have if made in a state of equilibrium" (Brodie, citing Clausewitz, p. 667).

## 📘 Book VI: Defense (Ch. 1-9, 25-30) (pp. 357-392; 469-519)

### Chapter One: Attack and Defense

• Summary: Defense is defined as parrying a blow and awaiting attack, which is its distinguishing feature. While pure defense is impractical in war, defense must be relative, involving offensive acts within one's own territory. Clausewitz strongly argues that defense is a stronger form of war than attack, serving as a "shield made up of well-directed blows".

> "Defense, as we see it, is nothing but the stronger form of combat. The preservation of one’s fighting forces and the destruction of the enemy’s—in a word, victory—is the substance of this struggle; but it can never be its ultimate object" (Clausewitz, p. 390).

> "Thus, a defensive campaign can be fought with offensive battles, and in a defensive battle, we can employ our divisions offensively. Even in a defensive position awaiting the enemy assault, our bullets take the offensive. So the defensive form of war is not a simple shield, but a shield made up of well-directed blows" (Clausewitz, p. 357).

### Chapter Two: The Relationship between Attack and Defense in Terms of the Nature of War

• Summary: This chapter elaborates on the inherent advantages of defense, particularly its ability to compel the attacker to expend force as he advances, and the strategic flexibility gained by choosing the time and place of engagement. Defense, by its nature, can draw on resources and conditions that reinforce its position, often leading to a natural superiority over the offensive.

> "All this should suffice to justify our proposition that defense is a stronger form of war than attack" (Clausewitz, p. 365).

> "defense has a natural superiority in the use of the means—other than the absolute strength and quality of the forces—that determine tactical and strategic success. Among them are advantage of terrain, surprise, concentric attack, advantages of the theater of operations, support of the populace, and the harnessing of moral forces" (Clausewitz, p. 372).

### Chapter Three: The Relationship between Attack and Defense in Terms of Time and Space

• Summary: This chapter highlights how the defender gains advantages in terms of time and space. The act of waiting allows the attacker's strength to diminish as he extends his lines of communication, while the defender operates on shorter, more secure lines. This spatial and temporal advantage allows the defender to select favorable conditions for engagement, further reinforcing the argument for defense's inherent strength.

> "All this should suffice to justify our proposition that defense is a stronger form of war than attack" (Clausewitz, p. 365).

> "The important moral forces that sometimes permeate war like a leaven may occasionally be used by a commander to invigorate his troops. These forces may be found on the side of defense as well as that of attack" (Clausewitz, p. 365).

### Chapter Four: Convergence of Attack and Divergence of Defense

• Summary: Clausewitz examines the concepts of convergent attack and divergent defense, explaining that these are not intrinsically necessary forms but rather common patterns of force employment. He aims to analyze them as abstract principles to clarify their essence without overstating their inherent advantages or disadvantages, suggesting they are often unconsciously regarded as indispensable but are, in fact, tactical or strategic choices.

> "These two concepts, these two ways of using one’s forces in attack and defense, crop up so frequently in theory and in practice that one unconsciously comes to regard them as inherent forms, almost as indispensable elements, of attack and defense. The slightest reflection will show that this is not actually the case" (Clausewitz, p. 366).

> "This concludes our discussion of the convergent and divergent effect of forces and of their relation to attack and defense; we shall return to both aspects at a later stage" (Clausewitz, p. 369).

### Chapter Five: The Character of Strategic Defense

• Summary: Strategic defense is presented as a powerful form of war that, while initially passive, is ultimately a means to enable a transition to the offensive. The defender's objective is to achieve victory, which allows him to then take the initiative and pursue more active war aims. Clausewitz emphasizes that defense should not be seen as mere endurance but as a calculated posture aiming for a decisive counter-stroke.

> "We have already stated what defense is—simply the more effective form of war: a means to win a victory that enables one to take the offensive after superiority has been gained; that is, to proceed to the active object of the war" (Clausewitz, p. 369).

> "A sudden powerful transition to the offensive—the flashing sword of vengeance—is the greatest moment for the defense" (Brodie, citing Clausewitz, p. 679).

### Chapter Six: Scope of the Means of Defense

• Summary: This chapter details the various means available to the defender that contribute to its inherent superiority, beyond just the strength and quality of forces. These include exploiting the advantages of terrain, achieving surprise, launching concentric attacks, utilizing benefits of the theater of operations, securing popular support, and harnessing moral forces. These elements serve as the "pillars" of defensive strength.

> "In Chapters Two and Three of this book we have shown that defense has a natural superiority in the use of the means—other than the absolute strength and quality of the forces—that determine tactical and strategic success. Among them are advantage of terrain, surprise, concentric attack, advantages of the theater of operations, support of the populace, and the harnessing of moral forces" (Clausewitz, p. 372).

> "the collective influence of the country’s inhabitants is far from negligible, even when we are not dealing with popular insurrection. At home, everything works more smoothly—assuming the public is not wholly disaffected" (Clausewitz, p. 374).

### Chapter Seven: Interaction between Attack and Defense

• Summary: Clausewitz explains that while attack and defense are logical antitheses, they are interdependent. The defender, by preparing for action and making dispositions to deter an enemy's advance, is often the first to commit an act that truly fits the concept of war, even if waiting. This dynamic interaction sets the stage for the evolving relationship between the two forms of warfare.

> "While it is quite natural and even indispensable to base the principles of defense on those that govern attack and vice versa, there must be a third aspect to one of them that serves as a point of departure for the whole chain of ideas and makes it tangible" (Clausewitz, p. 376).

> "It is the defender, who not only concentrates his forces but disposes them in readiness for action, who first commits an act that really fits the concept of war" (Clausewitz, p. 377).

### Chapter Eight: Types of Resistance

• Summary: Defense is characterized by two distinct elements: waiting and action, which are interwoven throughout a campaign or war. Clausewitz argues that "waiting" is a fundamental principle, allowing the enemy to exhaust himself, but its benefits are almost always realized in conjunction with actual or threatened military action. He illustrates this with historical examples where both elements, wearing down the enemy and direct fighting, contributed to defensive success.

> "The essence of defense lies in parrying the attack. This in turn implies waiting, which for us is the main feature of defense and also its chief advantage" (Clausewitz, p. 378).

> "By pointing out these two chief means of resistance, we hope we have explained clearly how the principle of waiting runs through the whole system and combines with the principle of positive action in such a way that the latter may appear early in one case and late in another" (Clausewitz, p. 385).

### Chapter Nine: The Defensive Battle

• Summary: This chapter explains that while a defensive battle involves awaiting the enemy's attack on one's position, it must incorporate an offensive element to achieve a decisive victory. The defender can strike back, using part of his force to hold and attacking with the rest. Clausewitz contends that all the consequences of a decisive victory can arise from this offensive phase within a defensive posture.

> "in the course of his defense the defender can fight a tactically offensive battle by seeking out and attacking the enemy as soon as he invades his theater of operations" (Clausewitz, p. 389).

> "And we are convinced that all the consequences of a decisive victory can and do result from this offensive phase, just as they do in a purely offensive battle" (Clausewitz, p. 389).

### Chapter Twenty-Five: Retreat to the Interior of the Country

• Summary: A voluntary retreat into the country's interior is an indirect form of resistance aimed at destroying the enemy through his own exertions rather than direct battle. This strategy capitalizes on the attacker's diminishing strength, increasing supply difficulties, and the defender's ability to operate on shorter, more secure lines. It is crucial that the retreat is not a result of severe defeat, and the defender must be able to influence the invader's direction and ensure the capital or key points are protected.

> "We regard a voluntary withdrawal to the interior of the country as a special form of indirect resistance—a form that destroys the enemy not so much by the sword as by his own exertions" (Clausewitz, p. 469).

> "The attacker is faced with the additional handicap that problems of supply make him spread out much more than the defender, and in consequence he always runs the risk of being overwhelmed by a superior force at some point" (Clausewitz, p. 471).

### Chapter Twenty-Six: The People in Arms

• Summary: This chapter examines popular uprisings, or "the people in arms," as a form of scattered resistance unique to modern warfare. While not suited for major engagements, their cumulative effect over time can consume the enemy's foundations, especially when coordinated with regular army operations. Clausewitz outlines conditions under which such insurrections are militarily effective, emphasizing that their strength lies in wide exposure and gradual attrition rather than concentrated force.

> "By its very nature, such scattered resistance will not lend itself to major actions, closely compressed in time and space. Its effect is like that of the process of evaporation: it depends on how much surface is exposed" (Clausewitz, p. 479).

> "To be realistic, one must therefore think of a general insurrection within the framework of a war conducted by the regular army, and coordinated in one all-encompassing plan" (Clausewitz, p. 479).

### Chapter Twenty-Seven: Defense of a Theater of Operations

• Summary: Clausewitz clarifies that the defense of a theater of operations is a unified effort where a "single center of gravity" determines the decisive point for victory. While territorial possession is a concern, the primary objective remains the preservation of one's own forces and the destruction of the enemy's. This chapter aims to provide a rationale for the strategic actions of generals in defending a country, linking localized defense to the overall war plan.

> "Defense, as we see it, is nothing but the stronger form of combat. The preservation of one’s fighting forces and the destruction of the enemy’s—in a word, victory—is the substance of this struggle; but it can never be its ultimate object" (Clausewitz, p. 390).

> "Our position, then, is that a theater of war, be it large or small, and the forces stationed there, no matter what their size, represent the sort of unity in which a single center of gravity can be identified. That is the place where the decision should be reached; a victory at that point is in its fullest sense identical with the defense of the theater of operations" (Clausewitz, p. 392).

### Chapter Twenty-Eight: Defense of a Theater of Operations—Continued

• Summary: This chapter details the interplay between the decision and the waiting period within the defense of a theater of operations. The goal is to maintain a position that allows for an advantageous decision at any moment, whether through direct battle, a series of engagements, or the mere effect of force dispositions. Clausewitz outlines various methods a defender can employ, such as concentrating forces, operating on flanks, or counterattacking, especially when a decisive confrontation is inevitable.

> "Defense, however, consists of two different elements—the decision and the period of waiting" (Clausewitz, p. 487).

> "Here the defense of a theater of war will consist of maintaining the position in such a way as to be able to bring about an advantageous decision at any moment" (Clausewitz, p. 488).

### Chapter Twenty-Nine: Defense of a Theater of Operations—Continued: Phased Resistance

• Summary: Clausewitz reaffirms his stance against resisting in successive phases, arguing that all available mobile forces should be used simultaneously for a decisive battle. While immobile means like fortresses and natural obstacles can be incorporated, phased resistance is primarily a method of postponing a decision, aiming to wear down the invader rather than achieve direct military defeat. This approach is only a specific type of resistance when postponement is the main objective.

> "In Chapters Twelve and Thirteen of Book Three we demonstrated that resistance in successive phases goes against the very nature of strategy and that all available forces should be used simultaneously" (Clausewitz, p. 498).

> "This particular form of resistance aims at making the invader wear himself out rather than at defeating him in battle. But a postponement of the decision can be considered as a special form of resistance only where that is the primary objective" (Clausewitz, p. 499).

### Chapter Thirty: Defense of a Theater of Operations—Concluded: Where a Decision Is Not the Objective

• Summary: This chapter describes defensive strategies where the objective is not a decisive battle but rather to gain time and wear down the enemy, often seen in "observation wars" or limited engagements. The defender exploits the advantage of waiting, leveraging uncertain intelligence and the intrinsic value of territory to force the attacker into difficulties. Natural obstacles play a paramount role in this more passive form of warfare, which aims to achieve results through attrition rather than direct confrontation.

> "We have argued in Chapter Three of this book that the state of waiting is one of the greatest advantages the defense enjoys over the attack" (Clausewitz, p. 501).

> "The less a decision can be expected, the more valid this objective will become. It is the governing principle in all such campaigns, even though superficially there may appear to be a lot of brisk activity, in the form of minor skirmishes which do not lead to decisive consequences" (Clausewitz, p. 505).

##  📕 Book VII: The Attack (Ch. 1-7, 15-16, 20, 22) (pp. 523-531; 545-550; 562-564; 566-573)

### Chapter One: Attack in Relation to Defense

• Summary: This chapter serves as a transition, introducing the attack as the logical antithesis to defense. Clausewitz states that while many aspects of attack can be understood through their opposition to defense, the offensive also possesses unique characteristics that require dedicated analysis. This closer examination will not only illuminate the nature of attack but also shed further light on defensive concepts.

> "Where two ideas form a true logical antithesis, each complementary to the other, then fundamentally each is implied in the other" (Clausewitz, p. 523).

> "A shift in our viewpoint will bring us nearer the subject, so that we can examine more closely what we previously surveyed from a distance. This will supplement our previous analysis; and what will now be said about attack will frequently also cast more light on defense" (Clausewitz, p. 523).

### Chapter Two: The Nature of Strategic Attack

• Summary: Clausewitz explains that while the offensive thrust is conceptually complete in itself, practical necessities introduce defensive elements into strategic attack. Periods of rest and the need to secure the rear or lines of communication force the attacker into temporary defensive postures. He characterizes this inherent burden as the "original sin" or "mortal disease" of the attack, making it perpetually combined with defense.

> "the attack is not a homogeneous whole: it is perpetually combined with defense. The difference between the two is that one cannot think of the defense without that necessary component of the concept, the counterattack. This does not apply to the attack. The offensive thrust or action is complete in itself" (Clausewitz, p. 524).

> "dominating considerations of time and space do introduce defense as a necessary evil... defense is an impeding burden to the attack, “its original sin, its mortal disease.”" (Brodie, citing Clausewitz, p. 694).

### Chapter Three: The Object of Strategic Attack

• Summary: The overarching object of strategic attack is the subjugation of the enemy, primarily achieved through the destruction of his fighting forces. This objective can manifest as the conquest of the entire country or a specific, politically valuable part of his territory, which can then be used for retention or bargaining in peace negotiations.

> "In war, the subjugation of the enemy is the end, and the destruction of his fighting forces the means. That applies to attack and defense alike" (Clausewitz, p. 525).

> "it need not be the whole country; it may be limited to a part—a province, a strip of territory, a fortress, and so forth. Any one of these may be of political value in negotiations, whether they are retained or exchanged" (Clausewitz, p. 525).

### Chapter Four: The Diminishing Force of the Attack

• Summary: This chapter explains that the strength of an attacking army naturally decreases as it advances into enemy territory. This diminishing force is attributed to the need to besiege fortresses, garrison occupied areas, and the general wear and tear from physical exertion and the increasing hostility of the operational theater. These factors inevitably weaken the effectiveness of the offensive machine.

> "The causes of loss in strength for an invading army are: 1. The invader has to besiege, assault or observe the enemy’s fortresses; while the defender, if he has previously been doing the same, will now add the units so employed to his main force" (Clausewitz, p. 566).

> "The moment an invader enters enemy territory, the nature of the operational theater changes. It becomes hostile. It must be garrisoned, for the invader can control it only to the extent that he has done so; but this creates difficulties for the entire machine, which will inevitably weaken its effectiveness" (Clausewitz, p. 566).

### Chapter Five: The Culminating Point of the Attack

• Summary: The "culminating point of the attack" signifies the moment when the attacker's diminishing superiority can no longer sustain the offensive, and the benefits gained are outweighed by the costs and risks of further advance. Beyond this point, the initiative can turn, and the attacker risks a strong counter-reaction, making it crucial to recognize when to consolidate gains and transition to defense to avoid disaster.

> "Beyond that point the scale turns and the reaction follows with a force that is usually much stronger than that of the original attack. This is what we mean by the culminating point of the attack" (Clausewitz, p. 527).

> "If the general relinquishes this aim because he considers the attendant risk too great, he will be right to break off and extend his front" (Clausewitz, p. 626).

### Chapter Six: Destruction of the Enemy’s Forces

• Summary: Clausewitz reiterates that the destruction of the enemy's forces is the military objective, but uniquely asks at what price this should be achieved. He explores different degrees of "destruction" needed and the costs involved, emphasizing the constant need to weigh gains against expenditures. He even suggests that indirect means, such as seizing territory, can be preferable to "pointless battles" that are indecisive but costly.

> "Destruction of the enemy’s forces is the means to the end. What does this mean? At what price?" (Clausewitz, p. 528).

> "He admits that such indirect means are generally overrated, that they are tempting only because they cost so little, but then adds significantly that they are “obviously preferable to pointless battles.” By “pointless” he clearly means indecisive but costly" (Brodie, citing Clausewitz, p. 694).

### Chapter Seven: The Offensive Battle

• Summary: Offensive battles are frequently characterized by uncertainty regarding the enemy's exact position, necessitating the concentration of forces. Clausewitz advises outflanking rather than directly enveloping the enemy in such situations. He also stresses that the most significant results and "real fruits of victory" in an offensive battle are achieved through relentless pursuit after the engagement.

> "A peculiarity in most offensive battles is doubt about the enemy’s position; they are characterized by groping in the dark—as, for example, at Austerlitz, Wagram, Hohenlinden, Jena, and Katzbach" (Clausewitz, p. 530).

> "By its very nature, pursuit tends to be a more integral part of the action in an offensive battle than in a defensive one" (Clausewitz, p. 531).

### Chapter Fifteen: Attack on a Theater of War: Seeking a Decision

• Summary: When attacking a theater of war with the goal of a major decision, the aim is not merely occupation but to reach the objective as a victor. The offensive must therefore prioritize striking at the enemy's army and its lines of communication rather than directly at the geographical objective itself, ensuring that victory is achieved on the path to the desired political aim, such as capturing a capital.

> "The concept of a self-contained theater of operations is in any case more closely associated with defense than with attack...the really basic and essential features of attack can be expounded only in connection with the subject of war plans" (Clausewitz, p. 545).

> "his blow must be aimed not just at the objective but at the road that the enemy will have to take to reach it. The road then becomes the first objective. Victory can be made more complete if we encounter the enemy before he has reached that objective, cutting him off from it and getting there first" (Clausewitz, p. 546).

### Chapter Sixteen: Attack on a Theater of War: Not Seeking a Decision

• Summary: This chapter discusses strategic attacks aimed at limited objectives rather than total defeat. If successful, such operations lead to a new state of balance. These "offensives of opportunity" or strategic maneuvers are often achieved without major engagements, focusing instead on threatening enemy lines of communication, seizing key resources or towns, or undermining allies. The goal is to force the defender to reposition or yield minor objectives, typically without aiming for a decisive battle.

> "Even where determination and strength will not suffice to bring about a great decision, one may still want to mount a strategic attack against a minor objective" (Clausewitz, p. 547).

> "The means that the offensive can use for this purpose derive from the interests that the defender has to protect in his theater of war. They will, therefore, consist in threatening his lines of communication, with its depots, rich provinces, important towns, or key points such as bridges, passes, etc." (Clausewitz, p. 547).

### Chapter Twenty: Diversions

• Summary: Diversions are strategic operations whose value is proportional to the unlikelihood of achieving a grand decision in the main war. A successful diversion must compel the enemy to commit more forces to counter it than the attacker expends, thereby creating a net benefit for the main objective. These can range from real attacks to feints, sometimes requiring a deliberate dispersal of forces.

> "The more remote the likelihood of a great decision in a war, the more legitimate it is to make diversions—but, of course, the smaller are the gains one can expect" (Clausewitz, p. 562).

> "A successful diversion, he says, must provoke the enemy to use more force in coping with it than one uses oneself, and must thereby be of net benefit to the main objective" (Brodie, citing Clausewitz, p. 697).

### Chapter Twenty-Two: The Culminating Point of Victory

• Summary: This chapter outlines the concept of the "culminating point of victory," which is the moment when a victorious attacker, having penetrated deep into enemy territory, finds his strength diminishing and the costs of further advance outweighing the potential gains. Beyond this point, the offensive risks a reversal, emphasizing the critical judgment needed to recognize when to halt the advance, consolidate gains, and transition to a defensive posture to avoid overextension and disaster.

> "This is why the great majority of generals will prefer to stop well short of their objective rather than risk approaching it too closely, and why those with high courage and an enterprising spirit will often overshoot it and so fail to attain their purpose" (Clausewitz, p. 573).

> "Just as no defensive campaign consists simply of defensive elements, so no offensive campaign consists purely of offensive ones. Apart from the short intervals in every campaign during which both sides are on the defensive, every attack which does not lead to peace must necessarily end up as a defense" (Clausewitz, p. 572).
