# **Winning Without Fighting**

  

Irregular Warfare and Strategic Competition in the 21st Century

  

## **Online Description**

  

A framework for U.S. grand strategy built around **irregular warfare (IW)**—understood as below–major-war competition aimed at expanding **influence** and **legitimacy** while weakening adversaries. The authors argue that today’s competition is also an “era of crises,” so effective strategy must integrate **military, economic, and information** tools with **resilience**, and it must include a way to **visualize and measure progress** across these domains.

## **60‑Second Brief**

- Core claim (1–2 sentences):
    
    - The outcome of today’s strategic competition will be decided less by major conventional war than by **persistent IW** and by how states navigate an **age of crises**—so the U.S. needs a **grand strategy** that integrates military, economic, information, and resilience tools (not just DoD).
        
    
- Causal logic in a phrase:
    
    - **Integrated statecraft + resilience → greater relative power/influence/legitimacy → adversary weakened & partners attracted → win without fighting.**
        
    
- Why it matters for IW / strategic competition (2–4 bullets):
    
    - Reframes IW as **grand-strategy level competition** (not a niche SOF/COIN problem) and ties it to strategic competition’s long duration.
        
    - Forces a **whole-of-government / whole-of-society** approach: resilience and domestic cohesion become strategic advantages (or vulnerabilities).
        
    - Provides a practical way to think in **dependent variables** (power, influence, legitimacy) rather than tool-worship (platforms, programs).
        
    - Argues for **measurement** as a strategic competency: competition is long, so you need feedback loops, not vibes.
        
    
- Best single takeaway (1 sentence):
    
    - Treat IW as the _default mode_ of strategic competition and run it like strategy—integrated tools, explicit objectives (power/influence/legitimacy), and a dashboard to measure progress over time.
        
    

  

## **Course Lens**

- How does this text define/illuminate **irregular warfare**?
    
    - Rejects a violence-only definition: “The sole focus on violence as a necessary condition for IW is not appropriate.” (p. 10)
        
    - Adopts IW as **activities short of conventional and nuclear war** aimed at expanding **influence + legitimacy** and weakening adversaries (p. 11).
        
    - Pulls IW upward: from tactics/operations to **grand strategy**, spanning **military, economic, information**, and **resilience** domains.
        
    
- What does it imply about **power/control**, **success metrics**, and **timeline** in IW?
    
    - **Power/influence/legitimacy** are the core lenses for IW outcomes (power = coercion; influence = convince; legitimacy = collective belief something is rightful) (p. 14).
        
    - Control is treated implicitly (especially via legitimacy, information control, and resilience), but the emphasis is on **competition for perceptions and alignment**, not simply territorial control.
        
    - Success metrics must be **relative and longitudinal**; grand strategies can last decades, so measurement against “final victory” is often infeasible (pp. 194–196).
        
    - Timeline: strategic competition is persistent and long-term; “Strategic competition is not war.” (p. 37)
        
    
- How does it connect to **strategic competition**?
    
    - Defines strategic competition as a long-term struggle among adversaries pursuing incompatible interests, often _without armed conflict_ (p. 8).
        
    - Positions IW as a primary way states pursue those interests below the threshold of major war, especially under nuclear shadow + high costs of near-peer war.

## **✅ Direct Responses to Seminar Questions**

- **Q:** What does _Winning without Fighting_ offer for understanding IW, evaluating adversaries, and preparing for future conflict?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - **A widened IW definition** that treats below–major-war competition as a central strategic arena, not a peripheral “irregular” side show (pp. 10–11).
            
        - A clear set of **strategic outcomes** to optimize for: **power, influence, legitimacy** (pp. 14–15), rather than equating progress with activity (operations executed, dollars spent, tweets posted).
            
        - A practical **grand strategy framework**: integrate _military statecraft_, _economic statecraft_, _information statecraft_, and _resilience_—explicitly beyond DoD (Book overview, pp. 16–19).
            
        - A competitor-focused lens that treats adversary behavior as coherent (culture + tools), not random “gray zone” incidents (Ch. 3; Ch. 2).
            
        - A persistent warning: strategy must fit a long competition—“Strategic competition is not war.” (p. 37)
            
        - A push toward **measurement discipline** (dashboard logic) to avoid strategic drift in a decades-long contest (Ch. 9).
            
        
    
- **Q:** How are competitors/adversaries incorporating IW into their strategies?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - **China and Russia integrate multiple IW tools** to build influence and legitimacy while weakening rivals—often below the threshold of open conflict (Ch. 3).
            
        - **China**:
            
            - Employs military-adjacent “gray” tools (e.g., maritime militia) to press territorial claims while preserving plausible legitimacy (p. 50).
                
            - Uses information statecraft through frameworks like “Three Warfares” (public opinion, psychological, legal) to shape perceptions and justify actions (pp. 56–57).
                
            - Builds resilience through “holistic national security” and surveillance; pairs resilience with economic planning to reduce dependence (“dual circulation”) (pp. 60–61).
                
            
        - **Russia**:
            
            - Uses “active measures” traditions and rejects neat war/peace boundaries, increasing risk acceptance and blending tools (Ch. 3).
                
            - Uses proxies and plausibly deniable actors (e.g., Wagner) for influence and resource access—but with blowback risks (pp. 52–53).
                
            - Leverages economic coercion (notably energy) and adapts to sanctions; complements with domestic repression and narratives to sustain regime resilience (pp. 54–55, 61).
                
            
        - Both exploit vulnerabilities of open societies (especially in the information environment) and seek wedges among alliances (Ch. 3 conclusion).
            
        
    
- **Q:** How well equipped is the US to counter these strategies?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - The U.S. has major **strategic culture headwinds**: preference for overwhelming force, binary war/peace thinking, and a bias for action/tech solutions that can misfit persistent IW competition (Ch. 2; see also p. 37).
            
        - DoD and national security institutions have struggled with **definitions and scope**—narrow, violence-centered conceptions of IW can misdiagnose the competition (p. 10; Ch. 1).
            
        - U.S. strengths exist (alliances, economic scale, legitimacy potential), but they require **integration** across agencies and society; the authors argue DoD alone is insufficient (Ch. 1; Ch. 10).
            
        - Key gaps the book highlights:
            
            - **Information statecraft** fragmentation (multiple actors; inconsistent strategy) (Ch. 7).
                
            - **Economic statecraft** tradeoffs (coercion tools can erode legitimacy and accelerate adversary adaptation) (Ch. 6).
                
            - **Resilience** underinvestment: “exquisite” military technology can be irrelevant against crises like pandemics and extreme weather (p. 219).
                
            - **Measurement**: weak feedback loops produce strategic drift (Ch. 9).
                
            
        
    
- **Q:** What distinctions exist between IW and great power competition/strategic competition?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - In this book’s framing, **strategic competition** is the overarching context: a persistent long-term struggle among adversaries pursuing incompatible interests (p. 8).
            
        - **IW** is a major _mode of action_ within that competition: activities short of conventional/nuclear war to expand influence/legitimacy and weaken adversaries (p. 11).
            
        - Practical distinction:
            
            - Strategic competition = **the game**
                
            - IW = **how the game is usually played** (below major war), especially when major war is too costly (Ch. 4 arguments; Ch. 1–3).
                
            
        - The authors’ culture critique reinforces the distinction: “Strategic competition is not war.” (p. 37)
            
        
    
- **Q:** How should DoD allocate resources to prepare for future conflict?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - Maintain credible warfighting deterrence, but accept that **conventional military capabilities alone** are insufficient for prevailing in the coming era (p. 224).
            
        - Invest more deliberately in **non-kinetic military statecraft** (security cooperation, partner capacity, posture, presence, institutional relationships) rather than treating them as secondary to “real war” readiness (Ch. 5).
            
        - Reduce organizational friction so capability can move at the pace of competition: reform acquisition/PPBE and close the “valley of death” between innovation and fielding (Ch. 5).
            
        - Treat resilience as strategy enabler:
            
            - DoD should plan for crises (pandemics, extreme weather) that can directly degrade readiness and legitimacy (Ch. 8; p. 219).
                
            
        - Resource allocation implication (from the book’s logic):
            
            - Shift some marginal dollars from exquisite platforms toward **campaigning capacity**: security cooperation, information support, resilience of bases/logistics, and interagency integration.
                
            
        
    
- **Q:** When/where are we likely to see IW during great power competition?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - “Below-threshold” competition where states can gain advantage without triggering open war—especially in **information**, **economic**, and **gray military** arenas (Ch. 3; Ch. 7).
            
        - Regions and issue areas where competitors can pressure without clear casus belli (examples used in the book include maritime coercion/territorial pressure, energy leverage, and influence operations) (Ch. 3).
            
        - During crises (natural disasters, pandemics, economic shocks) that create openings for influence and legitimacy competition—hence the centrality of resilience (Ch. 8; Ch. 10).
            
        - In and around allied/partner states—especially those geographically adjacent to competitors—where building resistance and resilience can deter aggression (Ch. 8 conclusion).

## **Chapter-by-Chapter Breakdown**

  

### **Chapter 1: Introduction (pp. 1–20)**

- **One-sentence thesis:** The U.S. faces strategic competition in an “age of crises,” so it needs a grand strategy centered on IW—integrating military, economic, information, and resilience tools beyond DoD.
    
- **What happens / what the author argues (5–10 bullets):**
    
    - Frames the strategic environment as two intertwined challenges: competitor rivalry and transnational crises.
        
    - Argues the U.S. needs a **grand strategy** for winning without fighting—because major war with near-peers is catastrophic and competition happens mostly below war.
        
    - Critiques narrow IW definitions and insists IW must include nonviolent/non-kinetic competition (pp. 10–11).
        
    - Adopts a specific definition of strategic competition and explains why (p. 8).
        
    - Defines core dependent variables: **power, influence, legitimacy** (pp. 14–15).
        
    - Previews the book’s tool-based structure: military, economic, information, resilience (Book overview, pp. 16–19).
        
    - Introduces measurement as essential for long-term competition (sets up Ch. 9).
        
    
- **Key concepts introduced (0–5):**
    
    - Strategic competition (definition adopted from Joint Concept for Competing) (p. 8)

- **IW / strategy relevance (2–4 bullets):**
    
    - Shifts IW from “how insurgents fight” to “how states compete.”
        
    - Builds a strategist’s vocabulary for non-war outcomes (legitimacy/influence).
        
    - Forces integration with resilience (IW can exploit crisis-driven vulnerabilities).
        
    
- **Links to seminar questions:** Q1, Q3; podcast distinctions (IW vs strategic competition)
    
- **Notable quotes (0–2):**
    
    - “The sole focus on violence as a necessary condition for IW is not appropriate.” (p. 10)
        
    

  

### **Chapter 2: American Strategic Culture (pp. 21–42)**

- **One-sentence thesis:** U.S. strategic culture—especially preferences for decisive solutions and overwhelming force—creates blind spots for long-term IW competition.
    
- **What happens / what the author argues (5–10 bullets):**
    
    - Defines strategic culture and explains why it matters for strategy and state behavior.
        
    - Argues strategic culture changes slowly and is shaped by history/geography/institutions.
        
    - Describes American political traditions (Hamiltonian/Wilsonian/Jeffersonian/Jacksonian) and their strategic implications (p. 26).
        
    - Highlights U.S. tendencies: war/peace dichotomy, moral framing (“crusade”), optimism and a belief problems yield to effort/technology (p. 30).
        
    - Notes risks of American isolation and mirror imaging—misreading what others value and want (p. 32).
        
    - Emphasizes the mismatch between strategic competition’s persistence and U.S. preference for decisive outcomes.
        
    - Sets up why U.S. institutions over-privilege kinetic tools and under-privilege influence/legitimacy campaigns.
        
    
- **Key concepts introduced (0–5):**
    
    - Strategic culture (and how it shapes tool choice)

- **Evidence / cases used:**
    
    - Canonical thinkers and strategic culture scholarship
        
    - U.S. historical narratives (frontier optimism; war/peace conceptualization)
        
    
- **IW / strategy relevance (2–4 bullets):**
    
    - Explains why U.S. often struggles with “in-between” conflict and below-threshold competition.
        
    - Flags institutional/cultural constraints on implementing whole-of-government IW strategy.
        
    
- **Links to seminar questions:** Q3; podcast distinctions
    
- **Notable quotes (0–2):**
    
    - “Strategic competition is not war.” (p. 37)
        
    

  

### **Chapter 3: Competitor Approaches to Irregular Warfare (pp. 43–66)**

- **One-sentence thesis:** China and Russia employ IW as integrated statecraft rooted in strategic culture—mixing military, economic, information, and resilience tools to gain advantage below major war.
    
- **What happens / what the author argues (5–10 bullets):**
    
    - Explains how strategic culture shapes competitor preferences and risk tolerance.
        
    - China:
        
        - Strategic narratives (e.g., “Century of Humiliation”) and sensitivity to foreign influence; emphasis on winning without fighting.
            
        - Uses gray-zone military tools and partnerships to expand influence while preserving legitimacy (e.g., maritime militia) (p. 50).
            
        
    - Russia:
        
        - More risk-acceptant; less committed to war/peace separation; draws on traditions of “active measures.”
            
        - Uses proxies/separatists/private forces to pursue influence with deniability, but with blowback risks (pp. 52–53).
            
        
    - Maps competitor behavior across the four tool domains (military/economic/information/resilience).
        
    - Argues open societies are vulnerable to disinformation, while democracies retain offsetting advantages (innovation/economic dynamism).
        
    
- **Key concepts introduced (0–5):**
    
    - China’s “Three Warfares” (public opinion, psychological, legal) (pp. 56–57)
        
    - National resilience as competitor tool (pp. 60–61)
        
    
- **Evidence / cases used:**
    
    - China: maritime militia, BRI-linked security influence, “Three Warfares,” surveillance and “dual circulation” (pp. 50, 56–57, 60)
        
    - Russia: Wagner/proxies, energy leverage, censorship/repression around Ukraine invasion, sanctions preparation (pp. 52–55, 61)
        
    
- **IW / strategy relevance (2–4 bullets):**
    
    - Provides a threat model: competitor IW is systematic, not episodic.
        
    - Shows how legitimacy/influence can be pursued through “nonmilitary” tools with military support.
        
    
- **Links to seminar questions:** Q2 (primary), Q1
    
- **Notable quotes (0–2):**
    
    - TBD (use chapter 3 primarily for cases; major definitional quotes appear elsewhere)
        
    

  

### **Chapter 4: The Past as Potential Prologue: Political Warfare during the Cold War (pp. 67–88)**

- **One-sentence thesis:** Cold War political warfare illustrates how the U.S. can compete effectively below war via integrated tools—if it aligns strategy, domestic politics, alliances, and legitimacy.
    
- **What happens / what the author argues (5–10 bullets):**
    
    - Uses the Cold War as a comparative case to illuminate political warfare’s utility and limits.
        
    - Defines political warfare (via Kennan) and situates it within a broader IW taxonomy (p. 69).
        
    - Describes “multiple faces” of political warfare: overt alliances/economic measures/“white” propaganda and covert support/“black” operations (p. 69).
        
    - Highlights the importance of U.S. domestic opinion and legitimacy for sustaining long campaigns.
        
    - Discusses Reagan-era political warfare as broad, integrated competition leveraging alliances, economic strength, and ideological messaging.
        
    - Summarizes contemporary arguments for renewed political warfare capacity:
        
        - near-peer war is too costly,
            
        - adversaries are outcompeting the U.S. below war,
            
        - political warfare enables integrated grand strategy,
            
        - adversaries have vulnerabilities,
            
        - cyber operations are now necessary (p. 80).
            
        
    
- **Key concepts introduced (0–5):**
    
    - Political warfare (Kennan)
        
    - Cold War containment as long-duration competitive strategy
        
    
- **Evidence / cases used:**
    
    - Kennan’s policy conception
        
    - Cold War institutions and tools (alliances, economic measures, information and covert action)
        
    - Reagan-era campaign debates and contemporary “renewed political warfare” arguments
        
    
- **IW / strategy relevance (2–4 bullets):**
    
    - Reinforces the “below-war” strategic logic: major war is catastrophic; competition happens in the seams.
        
    - Provides historic template for whole-of-government integration and legitimacy management.
        
    
- **Links to seminar questions:** Q1; podcast Cold War distinctions; Q3
    
- **Notable quotes (0–2):**
    
    - “Political warfare is the employment of all the means at a nation’s command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives.” (p. 69, George Kennan)
        
    

  

### **Chapter 5: Tools of Military Statecraft (pp. 89–112)**

- **One-sentence thesis:** Military power in strategic competition is more than combat; the U.S. must leverage non-kinetic military statecraft to build power, influence, and legitimacy—and modernize how it innovates and cooperates.
    
- **What happens / what the author argues (5–10 bullets):**
    
    - Argues the U.S. over-focuses on kinetic concepts and underuses the military as a **statecraft** tool.
        
    - Frames military tools against dependent variables: coercive power, influence-building, legitimacy signaling.
        
    - Organizes military tools into:
        
        - **Interpersonal tools** (engagements, education/exchanges, leader relationships).
            
        - **Organizational tools** (security cooperation, capacity building, arms sales/assistance, advising).
            
        - **Systemic tools** (force posture, deterrence architecture, modernization, alliance system).
            
        
    - Warns that competitors exploit seams; U.S. needs persistent campaigning with allies/partners.
        
    - Recommendations emphasize:
        
        - Employ the full spectrum of military statecraft

### **Chapter 6: Tools of Economic Statecraft (pp. 113–140)**

- **One-sentence thesis:** Economic statecraft is central to winning without fighting, but coercive tools (sanctions, controls) must be used carefully to avoid legitimacy loss and adversary adaptation.
    
- **What happens / what the author argues (5–10 bullets):**
    
    - Explains why economic tools are uniquely powerful in modern competition (interdependence, global finance, supply chains).
        
    - Distinguishes economic power vs influence and connects both to legitimacy costs/benefits.
        
    - Surveys key tool categories:
        
        - Trade-based tools and agreements
            
        - Export controls

        - Domestic policies that shape competitiveness and resilience (industrial policy, critical tech, energy/commodities)
            
        
    - Highlights legitimacy risks: coercive tools can be seen as punishment/imperialism and can fragment coalitions.
        
    - Argues the U.S. must avoid self-defeating protectionism and preserve openness where it strengthens influence and legitimacy.

### **Chapter 7: Tools of Information Statecraft (pp. 141–166)**

- **One-sentence thesis:** Information is contested terrain in strategic competition; the U.S. needs definitional clarity and a coordinated national approach to defend legitimacy and compete for influence.
    
- **What happens / what the author argues (5–10 bullets):**
    
    - Defines the information environment (physical/informational/cognitive dimensions) and why it matters.
        
    - Separates overlapping concepts: propaganda, disinformation/misinformation, influence operations, information operations, information warfare.
        
    - Argues “truth decay” dynamics degrade shared reality and increase vulnerability to IW.
        
    - Frames information tools through power/influence/legitimacy: coercion, persuasion, and credibility.
        
    - Proposes a U.S. approach requiring:
        
        - comprehensive national-level information strategy
            
        - coordination across government

    - TBD
        
    

  

### **Chapter 8: Tools of Resilience (pp. 167–192)**

- **One-sentence thesis:** Resilience is both shield and sword in IW: crises create openings for adversary influence, so resilience-building must be treated as a core strategic instrument.
    
- **What happens / what the author argues (5–10 bullets):**
    
    - Adopts resilience as “adaptive capacity”: ability to adapt while fulfilling core purpose (p. 169).
        
    - Makes key assumptions explicit:
        
        - resilience must be anticipatory + reactive
            
        - tactical + strategic
            
        - includes robustness and fragility (p. 169)
            
        
    - Connects resilience to power/influence/legitimacy (resilience supports credibility, capacity, and stability).
        
    - Argues the U.S. must:
        
        - monitor national resilience
            
        - make resilience a central pillar of national security strategy
            
        - build collective resilience with allies (p. 185–186)
            
        
    - Uses crises (climate impacts, pandemics) as empirical motivation and as predictors of IW vulnerability.
        
    
- **Key concepts introduced (0–5):**
    
    - Resilience as adaptive capacity (p. 169)

    - Expands IW terrain to include crises and domestic preparedness as strategic competition variables.
        
    - Suggests resilience-building can preempt adversary exploitation and reduce coercive leverage.
        
    
- **Links to seminar questions:** Q1, Q3; podcast “where IW shows up” (crisis openings)

### **Chapter 9: Measuring Success (pp. 193–212)**

- **One-sentence thesis:** Winning without fighting demands measurement; the authors propose an IW dashboard to track relative power, influence, and legitimacy across domains over time.
    
- **What happens / what the author argues (5–10 bullets):**
    
    - Reviews why standard “end-state” measurement fails in long competitions (objectives shift; exogenous shocks; decades-long timelines) (pp. 194–196).
        
    - Uses **power, influence, legitimacy** as enduring dependent variables for measurement (p. 195).
        
    - Distinguishes measures of effectiveness (MOEs) from other assessment approaches and argues for iterative feedback loops.
        
    - Proposes a “Toward an Irregular Warfare Dashboard” model to visualize progress (p. 205).
        
    - States two principles for dashboard use:
        
        - metrics are **relative**
            
        - measurement should consider **collective** capability (p. 206)
            
        
    - Argues for a publicly accessible, government-wide measurement framework to support strategic discipline.
        
    
- **Key concepts introduced (0–5):**
    
    - Irregular Warfare Dashboard (p. 205)

- **IW / strategy relevance (2–4 bullets):**
    
    - Treats IW as campaignable and assessable—key for long-term strategic competition.
        
    - Creates common language for interagency coordination (power/influence/legitimacy measures).
        
    
- **Links to seminar questions:** Q1, Q3; podcast resource allocation (measure to manage)
    
- **Notable quotes (0–2):**
    
    - “All metrics are relative.” (p. 206)
        
    

  

### **Chapter 10: Conclusion: An American Grand Strategy for Winning Without Fighting (pp. 213–232)**

- **One-sentence thesis:** The U.S. needs a holistic, resilience-based grand strategy that embraces IW’s complexity, leverages whole-of-society power, and organizes tools around building relative power, influence, and legitimacy.
    
- **What happens / what the author argues (5–10 bullets):**
    
    - Argues domestic vulnerabilities must be central to strategy (crises, finite resources, domestic consent and susceptibility to influence) (p. 218–219).
        
    - Emphasizes that “exquisite” military tech can be irrelevant against many dominant threats (pandemics, domestic terrorism, extreme weather) (p. 219).
        
    - Outlines a framework for grand strategy built around:
        
        - clear dependent variables (power/influence/legitimacy)
            
        - integrated tool employment (military/economic/info/resilience)
            
        - coalitions/teams at every level
            
        
    - Calls for a “whole-of-society” approach akin to Cold War mobilization (p. 222).
        
    - Warns against negative U.S. culture tendencies (mirror imaging, tech solutionism, binary thinking) and urges leveraging positive traits (optimism, entrepreneurship) (pp. 224–225).
        
    - Includes a role for “fight back when necessary,” but emphasizes punitive tools should be used cautiously and collectively to preserve legitimacy.
        
    
- **Key concepts introduced (0–5):**
    
    - Domestic vulnerabilities as strategic variables (p. 218)
        
    - Whole-of-society approach as competitive requirement (p. 222)
        
    - “Positive peace” as aspirational end condition (p. 225)
        
    
- **Evidence / cases used:**
    
    - COVID-19 as example of nonmilitary systemic shock undermining readiness/strategy (p. 219)
        
    - Cold War analogy for whole-of-society competition (p. 222)
        
    
- **IW / strategy relevance (2–4 bullets):**
    
    - Converts theory into a strategist’s “way ahead”: teams, coalitions, resilience as pillar, and multidomain integration.
        
    - Emphasizes legitimacy management and coalition cohesion as core operational constraints.
        
    
- **Links to seminar questions:** Q1, Q3; podcast resource allocation; IW vs strategic competition
    
- **Notable quotes (0–2):**
    
    - “Like during the Cold War, a whole-of-society approach is required.” (p. 222)

## **Theory / Framework Map**

- Level(s) of analysis:
    
    - Strategic / grand-strategic (statecraft), with strong attention to domestic foundations of national power (resilience).
        
    
- Unit(s) of analysis:
    
    - States (U.S., China, Russia) and coalitions/alliances; also domestic societies as enabling base.
        
    
- Dependent variable(s):
    
    - **Power** (coercive ability)
        
    - **Influence** (ability to convince)
        
    - **Legitimacy** (collective belief something is rightful) (p. 14)
        
    
- Key independent variable(s):
    
    - How states employ integrated toolsets:
        
        - military statecraft
            
        - economic statecraft
            
        - information statecraft
            
        - resilience-building
            
        
    
- Mechanism(s):
    
    - Coerce/convince/legitimate → shape alignment, deter/compel behavior, and weaken adversary cohesion → relative advantage in long competition.
        
    
- Scope conditions / where it should NOT apply:
    
    - Less suited as a primary lens for high-intensity conventional warfighting design (it is about winning _without_ fighting).
        
    - Not a micro-theory of civil war violence or insurgent control dynamics (though relevant as context).
        
    
- Observable implications / predictions:
    
    - Competitors will increasingly prefer tools below major war due to catastrophic costs of near-peer conflict.
        
    - Campaigns that improve resilience should reduce openings for adversary IW exploitation during crises.
        
    - Overuse of coercive tools (esp. sanctions/info manipulation) can reduce legitimacy and coalition cohesion, weakening long-term influence.
        
    

  

## **Key Concepts & Definitions (author’s usage)**

- **Strategic competition**
    
    - Definition: A persistent long-term struggle among adversaries pursuing incompatible interests without necessarily engaging in armed conflict (p. 8).
        
    - Role in argument: Sets the environment—competition is ongoing; war is not the default.
        
    - Analytical note: Forces timeline discipline; favors metrics and campaigning, not episodic reactions.
        
    
- **Irregular warfare (IW)**
    
    - Definition: “Activities short of conventional and nuclear warfare…designed to expand…influence and legitimacy…[and] weaken…adversaries.” (p. 11, quoting Seth G. Jones)
        
    - Role in argument: Main “mode” of competition in today’s environment.
        
    - Analytical note: Expands IW beyond violence-centered COIN and toward multidomain statecraft.
        
    
- **Power**
    
    - Definition: Ability to coerce (p. 14).
        
    - Role in argument: One of three enduring outcomes for IW campaigns.
        
    - Analytical note: Observable via coercive leverage, capability, and credible threat; must be assessed relative to adversaries.
        
    
- **Influence**
    
    - Definition: Ability to convince (p. 14).
        
    - Role in argument: Central competitive currency below war.
        
    - Analytical note: Hard to measure directly; requires proxy indicators (alignment, partner policy choices, narrative uptake).
        
    
- **Legitimacy**
    
    - Definition: Collective belief among relevant population that something is rightful (p. 14).
        
    - Role in argument: Enables durable influence; constrains adversary options; affects coalition cohesion.
        
    - Analytical note: Often the binding constraint in IW—especially for democracies.
        
    
- **Political warfare**
    
    - Definition: “Employment of all the means…short of war, to achieve…national objectives.” (p. 69, Kennan)
        
    - Role in argument: Cold War precedent for integrated competition.
        
    - Analytical note: Useful bridge concept between IW and grand strategy; clarifies “means short of war.”
        
    
- **Information statecraft**
    
    - Definition: State use of information tools (sharing/manipulation/agreements) to pursue power, influence, legitimacy (Ch. 7).
        
    - Role in argument: Key terrain for legitimacy and persuasion competition.
        
    - Analytical note: Requires coordination across government and society; includes defense against disinformation.
        
    
- **Resilience**
    
    - Definition: Adaptive capacity—ability to adapt while fulfilling core purpose (p. 169, quoted/adopted).
        
    - Role in argument: Essential in an era of crises; reduces vulnerability to competitor exploitation.
        
    - Analytical note: Strategic variable, not “homeland” afterthought; spans infrastructure, governance, social cohesion, and institutions.
        
    
- **Irregular Warfare Dashboard**
    
    - Definition: Measurement framework to visualize progress across tools and outcomes (p. 205).
        
    - Role in argument: Enables strategic learning over long timelines.
        
    - Analytical note: Must be comparative and coalition-aware: “All metrics are relative.” (p. 206)

## **Key Arguments & Evidence**

- Argument 1:
    
    - **Strategic competition will be won largely below the threshold of major war**, through IW that builds influence and legitimacy while weakening adversaries.
        
    - Evidence/examples:
        
        - Definition-driven reframing of IW (pp. 8–11, 14)
            
        - Competitor tool integration across domains (Ch. 3)
            
        - Cold War political warfare precedent (Ch. 4)
            
        
    - So what:
        
        - U.S. strategy must prioritize campaigning, alliances, legitimacy, and resilience—not just war plans.
            
        
    
- Argument 2:
    
    - **U.S. over-militarized and culturally biased approaches create mismatches** for long-duration IW competition.
        
    - Evidence/examples:
        
        - American strategic culture traits (Ch. 2; p. 37)
            
        - Whole-of-society requirement and crisis-driven vulnerabilities (Ch. 8; Ch. 10)
            
        
    - So what:
        
        - Reform is strategic: institutions, resource allocation, and narratives must support integrated statecraft.
            
        
    
- Argument 3:
    
    - **Without measurement, long competitions drift.**
        
    - Evidence/examples:
        
        - Measurement problems in decades-long containment (pp. 194–196)
            
        - Dashboard principles (pp. 205–206)
            
        
    - So what:
        
        - Strategy needs feedback loops; otherwise the U.S. confuses activity for advantage.
            
        
    

  

## **⚖️ Assumptions & Critical Tensions**

- Assumptions the author needs:
    
    - Influence and legitimacy are **strategically decisive** and can be shaped by deliberate policy (not just structural luck).
        
    - The U.S. can coordinate whole-of-government/whole-of-society action at scale despite polarization and bureaucracy.
        
    - Allies/partners will broadly align if offered credible benefits and shared resilience frameworks.
        
    
- Tensions / tradeoffs / contradictions:
    
    - **Coercion vs legitimacy:** many powerful tools (sanctions, information manipulation, covert actions) can degrade legitimacy if perceived as hypocritical or imperial.
        
    - **Openness vs security:** democratic openness is both strength and vulnerability; tightening controls may protect against IW but undercut legitimacy.
        
    - **Measurement vs Goodhart’s law:** once metrics drive decisions, actors may optimize the metric rather than the strategy (inference).
        
    
- What would change the author’s mind? (inference)
    
    - Evidence that influence/legitimacy are epiphenomenal and that major war outcomes (or sheer industrial/military capacity) dominate long-term competition regardless of IW campaigning.
        
    - Demonstrated inability of democracies to sustain whole-of-society campaigns without unacceptable domestic costs.
        
    

  

## **Critique Points**

- Strongest critique:
    
    - **Concept stretching risk:** Defining strategic contests broadly as “IW” may blur useful analytic distinctions (IW vs general statecraft/competition), potentially weakening operational clarity.
        
    
- Weakest critique:
    
    - The Cold War analogy is used carefully (similarities noted, but differences acknowledged), so “it’s just the Cold War again” is not a fair read.
        
    
- Method/data critique (if applicable):
    
    - The dashboard logic is compelling, but influence/legitimacy indicators can be noisy and context-dependent; measurement may be contentious across agencies and allies.
        
    
- Missing variable / alternative explanation:
    
    - Structural economic and demographic trends (and domestic governance capacity) may dominate outcomes regardless of IW tool sophistication (partially addressed via resilience, but could be foregrounded more).

## **Policy & Strategy Takeaways**

- Implications for the US + partners:
    
    - Compete for **alignment and credibility**, not just battlespace advantage.
        
    - Treat **resilience** as a strategic capability on par with deterrence.
        
    - Build “teams” that go beyond alliances: economic, tech, governance, and resilience coalitions.
        
    
- Practical “do this / avoid that” bullets:
    
    - Do:
        
        - Use **power/influence/legitimacy** as the standard template for campaign design and assessment.
            
        - Coordinate coercive tools **collectively** with allies to preserve legitimacy and increase leverage.
            
        - Invest in **pre-crisis** resilience and partner capacity (reduce openings for adversary exploitation).
            
        - Build enduring information capabilities that emphasize credibility and institutional coordination.
            
        
    - Avoid:
        
        - Treating IW as a SOF-only or violence-only mission set (p. 10–11).
            
        - Assuming “more exquisite tech” equals advantage in a crisis-heavy era (p. 219).
            
        - Overusing coercive economic tools without legitimacy/collateral effects analysis.
            
        
    
- Risks / second-order effects:
    
    - Over-centralization of “information statecraft” can become domestic censorship creep (democracy legitimacy risk).
        
    - Sanctions and economic coercion can accelerate adversary alternative systems and fracture coalitions.
        
    - Partnering and resistance preparation can trigger escalation if perceived as regime-change (inference).
        
    
- What to measure (MOE/MOP ideas) and over what timeline:
    
    - MOEs (outcomes, relative):
        
        - shifts in partner alignment and coalition cohesion (influence)
            
        - trust in institutions / perceived legitimacy at home and abroad (legitimacy)
            
        - adversary coercive leverage reduction (power)
            
        - resilience indicators: preparedness, redundancy, recovery time from shocks (resilience)
            
        
    - MOPs (activities):
        
        - security cooperation depth/quality (not just count)
            
        - economic agreements and targeted controls implementation
            
        - information campaign reach and credibility measures
            
        
    - Timeline:
        
        - Track quarterly/annually, but interpret over multi-year windows; strategic competition is long-duration (pp. 194–196).
            
        
    

  

## **⚔️ Cross‑Text Synthesis (SAASS 644)**

- Where this aligns:
    
    - **Simpson (War From the Ground Up):** war/competition as politics and narrative; this book operationalizes that via legitimacy/influence and information statecraft.
        
    - **Kalyvas (Logic of Violence):** both emphasize the centrality of civilian behavior and legitimacy/collaboration—but Patterson et al. stay at grand-strategic level.
        
    - **Biddle (Nonstate Warfare):** cautions against simplistic assumptions; similarly, this book warns against U.S. cultural/tool biases and “tech will solve it” instincts.
        
    
- Where this contradicts:
    
    - A narrower, violence-centered COIN/IW framing: Patterson et al. explicitly reject IW as necessarily violence-based (p. 10).
        
    - Any approach that treats “war” as the main determinant of strategic outcomes; the authors argue outcomes are largely decided short of war.
        
    
- What it adds that others miss:
    
    - A coherent **statecraft toolkit** + **measurement** frame: most IW texts argue what matters; this one argues how to integrate and assess it.
        
    - Resilience as a first-class strategic instrument in IW (Ch. 8), not an after-action domestic issue.
        
    
- 2–4 “bridge” insights tying at least TWO other readings together:
    
    - **Patterson + Kalyvas:** If legitimacy/influence drive strategic competition, then Kalyvas-style micro-dynamics (collaboration under control) become key _measurement_ inputs for “legitimacy” proxies.
        
    - **Patterson + Simpson:** “Messaging” is not a bolt-on; information statecraft is a principal line of effort whose success conditions include credibility and institutional coherence.
        
    - **Patterson + Mao:** “Protracted” conflict logic: long timelines privilege endurance, adaptation, and political mobilization—mirrored here by resilience and whole-of-society emphasis.

## **❓ Open Questions for Seminar**

- If IW is defined this broadly, what useful distinctions remain between **IW**, **statecraft**, and **strategic competition**? Where should SAASS draw lines?
    
- Are **influence** and **legitimacy** truly controllable variables for democracies, or are they mostly byproducts of domestic performance and global structure?
    
- What is the “minimum viable” whole-of-government architecture for this strategy—what gets centralized, and what must remain distributed?
    
- How do we prioritize across domains (military/economic/info/resilience) under resource constraints without defaulting back to “hardware-first” culture?
    
- When does “fight back when necessary” in IW (covert action, cyber, proxies) create escalation risks that outweigh legitimacy gains?
    
- What are the best leading indicators that resilience investments are actually reducing IW vulnerability—before the next crisis tests them?
    

  

## **✍️ Notable Quotes & Thoughts**

- “Strategic competition is a persistent and long-term struggle…without necessarily engaging in armed conflict with each other.” (p. 8, quoting _2023 Joint Concept for Competing_)
    
- “The sole focus on violence as a necessary condition for IW is not appropriate.” (p. 10)
    
- “Activities short of conventional and nuclear warfare…designed to expand a country’s influence and legitimacy…[and] weaken its adversaries.” (p. 11, quoting Seth G. Jones)
    
- “Strategic competition is not war.” (p. 37)
    
- “Political warfare is the employment of all the means at a nation’s command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives.” (p. 69, George Kennan)
    
- “The ability to adapt to changed circumstances while fulfilling one’s core purpose.” (p. 169, quoted/adopted from Zolli & Healy)
    
- “All metrics are relative.” (p. 206)
    
- “Like during the Cold War, a whole-of-society approach is required.” (p. 222)
    
- “Conventional military capabilities alone—or even primarily—are as insufficient for the coming era as they proved to be for the last one.” (p. 224)
    

  

## **Exam Drills / Take‑Home Hooks**

- Likely prompt 1: **“Is strategic competition best understood as irregular warfare? Evaluate Patterson et al.”**
    
    - Outline:
        
        1. Define strategic competition + IW (author definitions; scope implications)
            
        2. Show competitor practice (China/Russia multidomain tools) and why major war is unlikely/costly
            
        3. Critique: concept stretching, measurement challenges, and what the frame clarifies vs obscures
            
        
    
- Likely prompt 2: **“Design a U.S. grand strategy to win without fighting: ends, ways, means, and measures.”**
    
    - Outline:
        
        1. Ends: relative power/influence/legitimacy + resilience
            
        2. Ways: integrated statecraft across four domains; coalition “teams”; legitimacy-first sequencing
            
        3. Means & measures: rebalanced investments; dashboard metrics; timelines and feedback loops
            
        
    
- Likely prompt 3: **“How should DoD rebalance for IW in great-power competition?”**
    
    - Outline:
        
        1. Diagnose cultural/institutional bias (war/peace; overwhelming force)
            
        2. Prioritize military statecraft (security cooperation, posture, innovation) + resilience support
            
        3. Integrate with economic/info tools via interagency and allied coordination; measure outcomes
            
        
    
- If I had to write a 1500‑word response in 4–5 hours, my thesis would be:
    
    - The U.S. will prevail in strategic competition primarily by executing an integrated irregular-warfare grand strategy—building durable influence and legitimacy through whole-of-society resilience and multidomain statecraft—while measuring progress over time rather than chasing decisive battles.
        
    - 3 supporting points:
        
        1. Strategic competition’s long duration + catastrophic war costs shift advantage to below-war campaigns (political warfare logic).
            
        2. Competitors already exploit military/economic/information/resilience seams; the U.S. must integrate tools and fix cultural blind spots.
            
        3. Measurement discipline (dashboard) is necessary for long-term strategy under uncertainty and shocks.
            
        
    - 1 anticipated counterargument:
        
        - Broad IW framing dilutes analytical clarity and risks underpreparing for conventional war; “winning” may still hinge on hard power and industrial capacity.
