# **Pacification in Algeria, 1956–1958**

  

## **🎙️ Comps Prep (Oral Comprehensive Exam)**

- If insurgents can shelter inside population control (cells + terror), then tactical attrition will not end the war, because “the objective is the population” and the fight is for control/support. So what for strategy: reframe success as _organized_ civilian alignment, not enemy KIA. (p. 246)
    
- If the counterinsurgent expects spontaneous “hearts and minds,” then pacification stalls, because support is not spontaneous and must be organized through an identifiable pro-government minority that can pull neutrals over time. So what for strategy: build and protect a local political base before chasing “development” effects. (pp. 246–247)
    
- If the counterinsurgent cannot saturate the whole battlespace, then trying to do everything everywhere fails, because control/support tasks force an “area by area” approach and demand early visible wins to change civilian expectations about who will prevail. So what for strategy: sequence the campaign and prioritize early proof of victory. (pp. 246–247)
    
- If IW is “strategic” in the political sense, then Galula’s micro-level pacification logic aligns with Kalyvas’s control→collaboration intuition: civilians shift behavior once a side demonstrates durable local control and protection. Bridge: this aligns with Kalyvas on collaboration/control and usefully complements Simpson’s “war as politics” frame. (p. 209; pp. 246–247)
    

  

## **Online Description**

  

A first-person RAND memorandum reconstructing David Galula’s 1956–1958 experience in Kabylia during the Algerian War, focused on “pacification” as the central operational problem: controlling and winning population support rather than relying on military operations alone. (Summary, pp. xvii–xix)

  

## **Author Background**

  

Galula was a Saint-Cyr graduate and French Army officer with experience across “revolutionary warfare” theaters: WWII service, observation of communist guerrillas in China, UN military observation in Greece, and an attaché post in Hong Kong. He volunteered for Algeria in 1956, commanded a company in Kabylia, later worked at French defense headquarters, attended the U.S. Armed Forces Staff College, and served as a research associate at Harvard’s Center for International Affairs before writing for RAND. (Preface, pp. ix–x)

## **60‑Second Brief**

- **Core claim (1–2 sentences):** In insurgency/counterinsurgency, the decisive struggle is political control of the population; destroying guerrillas and holding terrain are insufficient if the counterinsurgent cannot control and organize civilian support. (pp. 246–247; Summary, pp. xix–xxi)
    
- **Causal logic in a phrase:** _Control → protected minority → organized support → intelligence + isolation of insurgents → durable pacification._ (pp. 246–247; Summary, pp. xix–xxii)
    
- **Why it matters for IW / strategic competition (2–4 bullets):**
    
    - Population behavior follows perceived victor/protector more than ideology over time, so signaling resolve/consistency is an operational variable. (p. 247; Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii)
        
    - Pacification requires coercion + governance sequencing; “area by area” is not a preference but a constraint of manpower and control tasks. (p. 247)
        
    - Local success can be real yet strategically fragile if national politics are inconsistent; cabinet crises and policy uncertainty degrade local alignment. (Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii)
        
    
- **Best single takeaway (1 sentence):** Measure progress by _organized_ civilian cooperation under durable protection, not by tactical metrics. (pp. 246–247)
    

  

## **Course Lens**

- **How does this text define/illuminate irregular warfare?**
    
    - IW is a contest for political control where the population is “the real terrain of the war,” and violence/operations are means to affect that political balance. (p. 246; p. 209)
        
    - Insurgent momentum can start with “blind terrorism” for publicity/fear, then “selective terrorism” to lock in local control. (Summary, p. xvii)
        
    
- **What does it imply about power/control, success metrics, and timeline in IW?**
    
    - **Power/control:** Durable control is demonstrated through protection + policing + organizational penetration of villages (census, movement control, dismantling cells). (Summary, pp. xx–xxi)
        
    - **Success metrics:** Whether civilians cooperate openly, provide intelligence, and participate in local governance/defense structures—i.e., organized support. (pp. 246–247; Summary, pp. xix–xxii)
        
    - **Timeline:** Counterinsurgency seldom ends cleanly; final phases can persist for years even after major successes. (p. 245)
        
    
- **How does it connect to strategic competition?**
    
    - Political credibility/consistency is decisive: local gains can be undercut by national-level vacillation that signals possible abandonment. (Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii)
        
    - Colonial/global context shapes legitimacy and “psychological superiority,” constraining counterinsurgent strategy even with material dominance. (p. 245; Summary, p. xvii)

- Main objectives of French approach?
    
- How effective were French methods?

## **✅ Direct Responses to Seminar Questions**

- **Q:** What was the political relationship between France and Algeria? How did global context shape French COIN?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - Galula frames Algeria as a colonial conflict: “a colonial war on our part and a war for independence on the part of the FLN,” with “the ‘tide of history’” favoring the insurgents’ cause psychologically. (p. 245)
            
        - Demography/power relations mattered: nine million Muslims lived alongside one million Europeans who dominated political/economic life, shaping both grievances and the optics of rule. (Summary, p. xvii)
            
        - International environment was permissive for the FLN: Arab and communist countries favored rebellion; global opinion was not unsympathetic to nationalist anti-colonial aims. (Summary, p. xvii)
            
        - French political weakness/instability (Metropolitan cabinet churn) fed doubts among Algerians about the credibility of French promises and the durability of local alignment. (p. 243; Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii)
            
        
    
- **Q:** Main objectives of French approach?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - Strategic objective recognized (at least in consensus): “divorc[ing] the rebels from the population,” since “military operations could not by themselves bring a complete, definitive victory.” (pp. 64–65)
            
        - Operational objective in Galula’s formulation: control and then win/support the population—“the objective is the population.” (p. 246)
            
        - Build organized support by identifying a pro-government minority and using it to influence neutrals, rather than assuming sympathy equals support. (Summary, pp. xix–xx)
            
        - Practical pacification instruments included village-level control measures (census, movement checks), dismantling political cells, and then building local governance/auxiliary forces and civic programs. (Summary, pp. xx–xxii)
            
        - Late-war institutionalization: only in 1959 did theater command issue a comprehensive pacification blueprint (Plan Challe) incorporating methods proven in practice. (Summary, p. xxiii)
            
        
    
- **Q:** How effective were French methods?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - At the local level, Galula presents a case of strong effectiveness: purge methods dismantled village cells, and safeguards plus dispersal of small detachments helped prevent re-infiltration; rebels eventually abandoned the Aissa Mimoun range “as a lost cause.” (Summary, p. xxi)
            
        - Behavioral indicator: once French control was visible, villagers shifted from avoidance to open friendliness and willingness to defy insurgent rules—suggesting control changed the collaboration calculus. (Summary, pp. xxi–xxii)
            
        - Scaling problem: before Plan Challe, Algeria remained a “checkerboard” of pacification quality depending on individual commander initiative/conviction. (Summary, p. xxiii)
            
        - Strategic fragility: cabinet crises and policy uncertainty had adverse psychological effects on cooperative villages and emboldened insurgents, limiting what local effort could achieve. (Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii)
            
        - War-level paradox in Galula’s account: military success could be decisive tactically, yet political factors could determine the ultimate outcome. (Introduction, pp. 1–2; Preface, p. xi)
            
        
    
- **Q:** How well does Kalyvas explain French/Algerian interactions?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - Strong fit on **control→collaboration**: Galula describes a “barrier of silence” driven by insurgent surveillance/cells and fear of reprisals; cooperation increases after cells are destroyed and control is demonstrable. (Summary, pp. xx–xxi)
            
        - Strong fit on **selective/targeted mechanisms**: purge methods rely on identifying cell members and isolating militant supporters within villages, not indiscriminate force—consistent with micro-logic where information and local control shape violence/collaboration. (Summary, pp. xx–xxi)
            
        - Strong fit on **civilian risk calculus**: villagers cooperate when they believe French protection will persist; when national politics wobble, cooperation becomes dangerous and declines. (Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii)
            
        - Potential tension: Galula’s account emphasizes campaign design and administrative control tools (census/movement systems) as levers; Kalyvas’s framework may treat these as downstream of control rather than central instruments (inference).
            
        - Bottom line: Galula supplies granular mechanisms (cells, policing, village governance) that operationalize how “control” is produced, not just observed (inference).
            
        
    
- **Q:** How did this experience influence American COIN theory/ops?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - The book itself documents transmission pathways into U.S. professional/academic circuits: Galula attended the U.S. Armed Forces Staff College and later served at Harvard’s Center for International Affairs. (Preface, pp. ix–x)
            
        - RAND/ARPA context: the memorandum was produced within RAND’s counterinsurgency research for ARPA’s Project AGILE, situating it in U.S. defense analytic ecosystems. (Preface, p. xi)
            
        - The 2006 foreword explicitly frames continuing relevance for U.S. challenges in Iraq and “insurgencies elsewhere,” implying its use as a learning source in modern U.S. COIN debates. (Foreword to New Edition, p. vii)
            
        - Substantively, Galula’s codified “laws” and practical pacification technique offer a portable doctrine-like set of principles that U.S. COIN practitioners could adopt/adapt (e.g., population as objective; area-by-area sequencing). (pp. 246–247; Appendix 3, p. 298)
            
        - Any claim about direct doctrinal adoption by specific U.S. manuals/units is **TBD** without external sourcing (and is not established by this PDF).

### **Part Summary — PART TWO: The Struggle for Control of the Population (pp. 59–138)**

- Galula treats this as the mandatory first phase of counterinsurgency: impose control, dismantle insurgent cells, and build an initial pro-government organizational nucleus. (Summary, pp. xix–xxi)
    
- He operationalizes control through dispersal near villages, night ambushes, census/movement checks, and systematic “purges” of political cells. (Summary, pp. xx–xxi)

    - Defines population as the objective for both insurgent and counterinsurgent. (Summary, p. xix)
        
    - Treats support as active participation, not sympathy. (Summary, p. xix)
        
    - Argues support is not spontaneous and cannot be forced; it must be organized. (Summary, pp. xix–xx)
        
    - Starts with identifying a pro-government minority as the seed of organization and intelligence. (Summary, p. xix)

## **Theory / Framework Map**

- **Level(s) of analysis:**
    
    - Micro/meso (village, sous-quartier, company) linked to macro political credibility and strategy. (Summary, pp. xix–xxiii; pp. 243–247)
        
    
- **Unit(s) of analysis:**
    
    - Villages and their political cells; local leaders; company-level pacification cadres. (Summary, pp. xx–xxii)
        
    
- **Dependent variable(s):**
    
    - Degree of population control and organized support for the counterinsurgent (cooperation, governance participation, auxiliary defense). (pp. 246–247; Summary, pp. xix–xxii)
        
    
- **Key independent variable(s):**
    
    - Visible counterinsurgent control/protection; ability to dismantle insurgent political cells; credibility of ultimate victory (policy firmness). (pp. 246–247; Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii)
        
    
- **Mechanism(s):**
    
    - Destroy cells → break silence → identify pro-government minority → organize support → elections/leadership testing → mobilization + policing → deny re-infiltration. (Summary, pp. xx–xxii)
        
    
- **Scope conditions / where it should NOT apply:**
    
    - Generalization must account for Algeria-specific factors (geography, borders, colonial framing, political instability). (pp. 243–245; p. 2)
        
    
- **Observable implications / predictions:**
    
    - Where counterinsurgent is perceived as durable victor/protector, civilians increasingly cooperate regardless of ideology. (p. 247)
        
    - Absent a coherent method/doctrine, pacification will vary by commander (“checkerboard” outcomes). (Summary, p. xxiii)
        
    - If policy credibility wavers, local cooperation declines and insurgent morale stiffens. (Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii)
        
    

  

## **Key Concepts & Definitions (author’s usage)**

- **Pacification**
    
    - Definition: A population-centered effort to control and win support; not “candies to the children” but planned coercion + persuasion. (p. 270)
        
    - Role in argument: The main practical path to victory when military operations alone are insufficient. (pp. 64–65; Summary, p. xvii)
        
    - Analytical note: Treat as a sequenced process with measurable control/support indicators (movement control, cooperation, auxiliary participation). (Summary, pp. xx–xxii)
        
    
- **Population (as objective/terrain)**
    
    - Definition: The “objective” and “real terrain” of the war. (p. 246)
        
    - Role in argument: Reorients strategy away from enemy destruction toward civilian control/support.
        
    - Analytical note: Operationalize via cooperation rates, governance participation, and intelligence flow.
        
    
- **Support (organized, not spontaneous)**
    
    - Definition: Requires active participation; not sympathy; must be organized. (p. 246; Summary, p. xix)
        
    - Role in argument: The pathway to intelligence, isolation of insurgents, and durable control.
        
    - Analytical note: Track presence/strength of an active pro-government minority and its ability to influence neutrals.
        
    
- **Political cells (insurgent organization)**
    
    - Definition: Local insurgent structures that surveil and coerce villages, enforcing silence. (Summary, p. xx)
        
    - Role in argument: The key obstacle to cooperation; must be dismantled for control.
        
    - Analytical note: Measure via defection/disclosure patterns and re-infiltration attempts.
        
    
- **Purge**
    
    - Definition: A systematic method to identify and dismantle village cells and militant supporters. (Summary, pp. xx–xxi)
        
    - Role in argument: The gateway step to break terror control and enable cooperation.
        
    - Analytical note: High ethical/legitimacy risk; requires clear legal/institutional controls.
        
    
- **D.O.P.**
    
    - Definition: A special unit for detention/interrogation/intelligence support created in 1957. (p. 184)
        
    - Role in argument: Institutional fix for intelligence extraction and detainee handling; judged a major operational improvement. (p. 185)
        
    - Analytical note: See as an “intelligence institution” lever with legitimacy tradeoffs.
        
    
- **Area-by-area sequencing**
    
    - Definition: Concentrate efforts due to inability to saturate territory. (p. 247)
        
    - Role in argument: A structural necessity in COIN design.
        
    - Analytical note: Useful for campaign phasing and MOE design.
        
    
- **Strategic (political meaning)**
    
    - Definition: “Strategic” in insurgency means political, not conventional military. (p. 209)
        
    - Role in argument: Clarifies that military actions must serve political consolidation.
        
    - Analytical note: Use to evaluate whether operations produce political control effects.

## **Key Arguments & Evidence**

- **Argument 1: Population control/support is decisive, not terrain or attrition.**
    
    - **Evidence/examples:**
        
        - “The objective is the population,” the “real terrain of the war.” (p. 246)
            
        - Military operations alone could not deliver definitive victory due to elusiveness, replacement, and slow effects. (pp. 64–65)
            
        
    - **So what:**
        
        - Campaign design must prioritize control tools, protection, and organized support as primary outputs.
            
        
    
- **Argument 2: Support must be organized via a protected minority; civilians follow perceived victor/protector.**
    
    - **Evidence/examples:**
        
        - Support is not spontaneous; must be organized through a minority, followed by majority only if counterinsurgent is seen as ultimate victor. (pp. 246–247)
            
        - Villagers cooperate once control is visible; cooperation drops with policy uncertainty. (Summary, pp. xxi–xxiii)
            
        
    - **So what:**
        
        - Early visible wins and consistent policy signaling are operational necessities, not just strategic messaging.
            
        
    
- **Argument 3: Method matters; absent doctrine, outcomes become a checkerboard; local success is scalable only via tested plans.**
    
    - **Evidence/examples:**
        
        - No single official doctrine; commanders improvised; “pacify” orders lacked precision. (pp. 64–65; Summary, p. xix)
            
        - Appendix 3 emphasizes testing, revising, then applying a plan with observers and control. (p. 298)
            
        
    - **So what:**
        
        - Institutional learning and standardization are part of strategy in IW, not administrative afterthoughts.
            
        
    
- **Argument 4: Tactical/military success can be undercut by political factors and credibility gaps.**
    
    - **Evidence/examples:**
        
        - Political instability and lack of clear policy as major factors. (p. 243)
            
        - Local limits driven by cabinet crises and uncertainty effects. (Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii)
            
        
    - **So what:**
        
        - IW success metrics must include political cohesion and commitment credibility as core variables.
            
        
    

  

## **⚖️ Assumptions & Critical Tensions**

- **Assumptions the author needs:**
    
    - Local civilians will shift cooperation when they believe the counterinsurgent will protect them and ultimately prevail. (p. 247; Summary, p. xxiii)
        
    - A pro-government minority exists and can be identified, protected, and organized. (p. 246; Summary, p. xix)
        
    - The counterinsurgent can apply a consistent method area-by-area and prevent re-infiltration with small garrisons. (p. 247; Summary, p. xxi)
        
    
- **Tensions / tradeoffs / contradictions:**
    
    - **Coercion vs legitimacy:** purge, detention, and interrogation can produce intelligence/control but risk delegitimizing the effort. (Summary, pp. xx–xxi; p. 184)
        
    - **Force protection vs dispersal:** fragmentation increases tactical risk but may be necessary to hold political control. (Summary, p. xxi)
        
    - **Local success vs national strategy:** local pacification can work yet remain fragile under national political vacillation. (Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii)
        
    
- **What would change the author’s mind? (inference)**
    
    - Evidence that civilians do not shift cooperation with durable protection/visible victory, or that such shifts do not translate into intelligence/control effects.
        
    

  

## **Critique Points**

- **Strongest critique:**
    
    - The work is explicitly a personal memoir with inevitable bias and limited systematic treatment of larger political questions, constraining external validity. (Preface, p. xi)
        
    
- **Weakest critique:**
    
    - “It’s just small-unit tactics” is incomplete; Galula explicitly frames the struggle as political-strategic and ties local outcomes to national credibility. (p. 209; Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii)
        
    
- **Method/data critique (if applicable):**
    
    - Galula relies on memory and kept no diary, increasing risk of selective recall or post hoc rationalization. (p. 2)
        
    
- **Missing variable / alternative explanation:**
    
    - The account may underweight structural legitimacy dynamics and international politics relative to what his local vantage can observe (noted by editors). (Preface, p. xi)

## **Policy & Strategy Takeaways**

- **Implications for the US + partners:**
    
    - Treat population control/support as the decisive objective; align tactics, governance, and messaging to that end-state. (pp. 246–247)
        
    - Build visible, durable protection and early partial successes to shift civilian expectations about the ultimate victor. (p. 247)
        
    - Institutionalize learning: test a method, revise it, then standardize with supervision; avoid perpetual local improvisation. (p. 298)
        
    
- **Practical “do this / avoid that” bullets:**
    
    - Do sequence “area by area” and resource hold tasks realistically. (p. 247)
        
    - Do dismantle local coercive-insurgent organization (cells) before expecting open cooperation or credible elections. (Summary, pp. xx–xxi; p. 147)
        
    - Avoid governance reforms/elections before security control; they can be captured by insurgent stooges. (p. 147)
        
    - Avoid policy ambiguity that signals potential abandonment; it directly degrades local cooperation. (Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii)
        
    
- **Risks / second-order effects:**
    
    - Detention/interrogation institutions can improve intelligence but create legitimacy and abuse risks. (p. 184)
        
    - Village garrisoning/dispersal increases tactical vulnerability and manpower strain. (p. 247; Summary, p. xxi)
        
    
- **What to measure (MOE/MOP ideas) and over what timeline:**
    
    - **MOE:** civilian cooperation rate (reports, tips), openness of interaction, participation in local governance, volunteer auxiliary force participation. (Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii)
        
    - **MOP:** number of villages purged/held; persistence of small detachments; movement-control compliance; frequency of insurgent re-infiltration attempts. (Summary, pp. xx–xxi)
        
    - **Timeline:** expect long tail; even after major success, residual insurgents can persist for years. (p. 245)
        
    

  

## **⚔️ Cross‑Text Synthesis (SAASS 644)**

- **Where this aligns:**
    
    - **Kalyvas:** Control and collaboration are linked; civilians cooperate when control/protection are credible—Galula’s “barrier of silence” and post-cleaning behavior shift map cleanly onto that logic. (Summary, pp. xx–xxii)
        
    - **Simpson:** War is politics; Galula explicitly uses “strategic” in the political sense and emphasizes narrative/credibility effects of political events. (p. 209; Summary, p. xxiv)
        
    
- **Where this contradicts (or complicates):**
    
    - Complicates “decapitation” intuitions: organizationally loose movements may absorb leader losses without collapsing (raised in editorial foreword excerpts). (Foreword, p. v)
        
    - Challenges purely “development-first” instincts: governance reforms and elections can backfire absent control; sequencing is decisive. (p. 147)
        
    
- **What it adds that others miss:**
    
    - Concrete, replicable micro-technique for producing control (census/movement checks, purge logic, garrisoning) and scaling learning via experiments/observers. (Summary, pp. xx–xxi; p. 298)
        
    
- **2–4 “bridge” insights tying at least TWO other readings together:**
    
    - Galula’s “population as terrain” (p. 246) plus Kalyvas’s collaboration logic suggests a shared metric: **durable local control that changes civilian risk calculus**—a bridge from theory to operational MOE.
        
    - Combine Simpson’s emphasis on politics/narrative with Galula’s cabinet-crisis effects: **strategic messaging is not additive; it is constitutive of local security outcomes** when it shifts beliefs about abandonment. (Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii)
        
    - Read alongside Mao (protracted war): Galula’s “area by area” sequencing (p. 247) reframes protraction as a resource/control constraint, not just an insurgent choice (inference).
        
    - Tie to Ladwig (patron-client): Galula’s insistence that a political party must ultimately carry the effort (p. 298) anticipates the sustainability gap when external forces cannot remain indefinitely (inference).

## **❓ Open Questions for Seminar**

- If “support” must be organized and cannot be forced, what is the ethical/strategic boundary between legitimate control measures (census/movement checks) and coercive overreach? (Summary, pp. xx–xxi)
    
- Is Galula’s purge logic portable outside village-centric settings, or does it depend on a particular social structure and informant ecology?
    
- How should strategists manage the “credibility” variable Galula highlights when national politics are inherently unstable in democracies? (Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii)
    
- Does the creation of institutions like the D.O.P. solve the intelligence problem or simply relocate legitimacy risk into a new apparatus? (p. 184)
    
- What is the minimum viable political organization needed to sustain local pacification if the counterinsurgent withdraws? (p. 205; p. 298)
    
- How should we reconcile Galula’s local tactical success claims with the war’s broader political outcome and decolonization dynamics? (Introduction, pp. 1–2; Preface, p. xi)

## **Exam Drills / Take‑Home Hooks**

- **Prompt 1:** “In IW, ‘the objective is the population.’ Defend or refute using Galula and at least one other theorist.”
    
    - **Outline:**
        
        1. Define the claim and the mechanism (control/support vs attrition). (pp. 246–247)
            
        2. Evidence from Kabylia: barrier of silence → purge/census → elections/mobilization. (Summary, pp. xx–xxii)
            
        3. Synthesis: compare to Kalyvas (control/collaboration) and implications for campaign metrics (inference).
            
        
    
- **Prompt 2:** “Why do local tactical successes fail to translate into strategic victory in IW?”
    
    - **Outline:**
        
        1. Local success logic (pacification technique). (Summary, p. xxi; p. 298)
            
        2. Strategic fragility: policy instability/credibility and limits to local efforts. (Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii)
            
        3. What to do: align political commitment, institutions, and sequencing; build sustaining political organization. (p. 205; p. 298)
            
        
    
- **Prompt 3:** “Are coercive control measures compatible with legitimacy in counterinsurgency?”
    
    - **Outline:**
        
        1. Identify required control tasks (movement checks, purge, detention). (Summary, pp. xx–xxi; p. 184)
            
        2. Legitimacy risks and institutional mitigation attempts (D.O.P.; ‘humanity and common sense’ margin). (p. 184; p. 270)
            
        3. Strategic tradeoffs and safeguards (legal boundaries, transparency, political coherence). (inference; anchored to Galula’s concerns)
            
        
    
- **If I had to write a 1500‑word response in 4–5 hours, my thesis would be:** Galula shows that effective counterinsurgency is a sequenced political-organizational campaign to control and then mobilize the population, and that local success is strategically fragile without credible, consistent national policy and sustaining political institutions. (pp. 246–247; Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii; p. 298)
    
    - **3 supporting points:**
        
        - Population is the objective; support must be organized; civilians follow perceived victor/protector. (pp. 246–247)
            
        - Kabylia case demonstrates a replicable method: dismantle cells, impose control measures, then build governance and mobilization. (Summary, pp. xx–xxii)
            
        - Local effort has limits under political uncertainty; sustainability requires political organization beyond the military. (Summary, pp. xxii–xxiii; p. 298)
            
        
    - **1 anticipated counterargument:**
        
        - Galula’s success may be context-dependent (colonial setting, specific social structure, coercive tools) and may not generalize cleanly; additionally, memoir/memory limitations complicate causal inference. (pp. 243–245; p. 2; Preface, p. xi)
