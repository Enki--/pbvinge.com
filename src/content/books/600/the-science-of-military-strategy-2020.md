# The Science of Military Strategy 2013

## Online Description

ENGLISH LANGUAGE TRANSLATION The Academy of Military Sciences of the People's Liberation Army of China issued a revised edition of its "The Science of Military Strategy" (SMS) in 2013. A Chinese-language copy was obtained by Secrecy News but I have not found an English language copy, so I decided to translate it into English myself. I am not a scholar of the Chinese language, but hopefully you will excuse my illiteracy as this is the only English version available. I believe the translation is faithful to the original, however I have taken some poetic license in order to improve the readability. Some of the colloquial expressions such as "two legged losers" (page 210) and use of a "private white hair to attack and defend the network" (page 196) went completely over my head, so I didn't make any attempt to edit them. I decided to limit the translated text on any given page in the original text to the same numbered page in this book. So, if you are unsure of the meaning of some of my edits - and, you happen to be a Chinese scholar - you will know what page to look for in the original Chinese edition. I must apologize because unfortunately, some text and sometimes complete pages of the copy I obtained were not legible, making accurate translation impossible. Where this occurs, I left that area blank so as to highlight that something is missing and added the word "Unintelligible". At the last minute I decided to also include the text of "China's Military Strategy" that was released by the State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of China in 2015. You will find that at the end of this book. It provides additional context to the 2013 document and should further clarify some of the meaning. Speaking about the Chinese language version of this book and the Science of Campaigns (2006), a team of authors from RAND Corporation who worked on a 2015 report stated: "To the best of our knowledge, these are the most authoritative publicly available sources on Chinese military thinking about the campaign level of warfare."

## 🔍 Author's Main Issue / Thesis
Science of Military Strategy (2020) systematizes a comprehensive PLA theory of strategy that guides both the use and construction of military power—across war and non‑war contexts and new domains—and updates China’s strategic theory to the “new era” (from informatization toward intelligentization), undergirded by enduring active defense principles (Xiao, 2020, pp. 15, 24–27, 452).  ￼  ￼  ￼  ￼

Direct quotes:

•	“The science of strategy is a theoretical system about strategy and a discipline that studies the overall guiding laws for the use and construction of military forces.” (Xiao, 2020, p. 15).  ￼

•	“Strategy is the overall planning and guidance for the use and construction of military forces.” (Xiao, 2020, p. 25).  ￼

•	“To strengthen the country and the army, strategy is first.” (Xiao, 2020, p. 24).  ￼

•	“Since the founding of New China, it has always adhered to the military strategy of active defense, which fully reflects the essential characteristics of China’s strategic cultural traditions.” (Xiao, 2020, p. 27).  ￼

•	The 2020 revision aims “to better adapt to the overall trend… from informatization to intelligence, [to] reveal the characteristics and laws of military conflict in the new era, [and] reflect the latest achievements in national defense and military reform.” (Xiao, 2020, pp. 451–452).  ￼

Key problems the book addresses:

•	Foundations of strategy. Defines strategy’s meaning, elements, characteristics, and influencing factors (Ch. 1), positioning strategy as the top‑level guide for military affairs (Xiao, 2020, pp. 15, 24–25).  ￼  ￼

•	A five‑link model of strategic practice. Operationalizes strategy through strategic judgment → decision‑making → planning → implementation → evaluation (Part I overview) (Xiao, 2020, p. 24).  ￼

•	Crisis management & deterrence. Develops frameworks for preventing/handling military crises (Ch. 7) and strategic deterrence concepts and guidance (Ch. 8) (Xiao, 2020, TOC pp. 10–12).  ￼

•	New domains of conflict. Extends strategy to space, cyberspace, deep‑sea, polar, biological, and intelligent domains (Ch. 9), reflecting the changing character of warfare (Xiao, 2020, TOC p. 11).  ￼

•	War planning & conduct. Details war planning (Ch. 10), war operations (Ch. 11), battle situation control (Ch. 12), and operational guidance (Ch. 13) (Xiao, 2020, TOC pp. 11–12).  ￼

•	Non‑war & overseas operations. Provides strategic guidance for non‑war military operations (Ch. 14) and the overseas use of forces (Ch. 15) (Xiao, 2020, TOC p. 12).  ￼

•	Force construction for the “new era.” Articulates service‑specific construction and capability requirements for Army, Navy, Air Force, Rocket Force, Space, Cyberspace, Joint Logistics, Armed Police, and Reserve forces (Chs. 16–25), aligning modernization with strategic aims (Xiao, 2020, TOC pp. 13–14).  ￼

SMS 2020 is best understood as the PLA’s authoritative, institutionally curated textbook on strategy—edited by Xiao—whose thesis is to codify a whole‑of‑force, whole‑of‑domain approach to using and building military power for China’s “new era,” while reaffirming active defense as its doctrinal bedrock (Xiao, 2020, pp. 24–27, 451–452).  ￼  ￼  ￼

## Cross‑cutting Chinese Strategic Concepts (for discussion)
- **People's war in the information age**: mobilizing technical talent and systems, not just manpower. (Xiao, 2020/2022, pp. 29–30).
- **Active defense**: fundamentally defensive but operationally proactive—*"We will not attack unless we are attacked; if we are attacked, we will certainly counterattack."* (pp. 30–31).
- **Military reform & intelligentization**: aim to win **informatized** and emerging **intelligentized** wars; develop asymmetric methods and integrate offense/defense. (pp. 31–35).

---

## Key terms & quick definitions
- **Strategic deterrence** — integrated use of military & non‑military means to coerce and shape adversary choices; stresses credibility and readiness. (Xiao, 2020/2022, pp. 132–140).
- **Battle situation control** — shaping tempo, space, and decision cycles to guide the course of war. (pp. 236–268).
- **Cyber/electromagnetic warfare** — continuous, ambiguous confrontation across peace/war thresholds; technical actions can yield strategic effects. (pp. 193–196; 237).

---

## Five fast takeaways
1) PLA strategy tracks **ends‑ways‑means** with Chinese characteristics (people's war, active defense). (Xiao, 2020/2022, ch. 1).
2) **Deterrence and crisis control** precede and shape war; **non‑war operations** and **overseas use** are integral missions. (chs. 7–8, 14–15).
3) **New domains** (space, cyber, intelligent) are central, not peripheral, to joint operations. (ch. 9).
4) **War planning & operations** emphasize legal/political constraints, information dominance, and joint fires–information integration. (chs. 10–11).
5) **Force construction** aligns to **informatization/intelligentization**, **quality‑and‑efficiency**, and **joint support** across all services, SSF, logistics, armed police, and reserves. (chs. 16–25).
