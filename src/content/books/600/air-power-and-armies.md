# Air Power and Armies

## Online Description

An account of Sir John Cotesworth Slessor (1897–1979), one of Great Britain's most influential airmen Sir John Slessor played a significant role in building the World War II Anglo-American air power partnership as an air planner on the Royal Air Force Staff, the British Chiefs of Staff, and the Combined Chiefs of Staff. He coordinated allied strategy in 1940–41, helped create an Anglo-American bomber alliance in 1942, and drafted the compromise at the Casablanca Conference that broke a deadlock in Anglo-American strategic debate. Slessor was instrumental in defeating the U-boat menace as RAF Coastal Commander, and later shared responsibility for directing Allied air operations in the Mediterranean. Few aspects of the allied air effort escaped his influence: pilot training, aircraft procurement, and dissemination of operational intelligence and information all depended to a degree on Slessor. His influence on Anglo-American operational planning paved the way for a level of cooperation and combined action never before undertaken by the military forces of two great nations.
  

## 🔫 Author Background
Wing Commander J. C. Slessor, the author of "Air Power and Armies," based his book on a series of lectures delivered at the Staff College at Camberley between 1931 and 1934. His primary motivation was to draw useful lessons for the future by analyzing the recorded experience of the last war, specifically the Royal Air Force's actions in overseas campaigns. Slessor aimed to help future commanders and staff officers understand how the "new power of the air is likely to affect the problems of land warfare" and to be "wise before the event". He wrote the book "in no spirit of destructive criticism," instead seeking to identify what "might have been done better" given that early air forces were "amateurs at a new art". His goal was to provide a reasoned examination of potential air action in cooperation with an army, using past examples as models for the future and suggesting improvements based on contemporary knowledge. The book also serves as a poignant dedication to Lieutenant Anthony Bristow Slessor of the 52nd Light Infantry.


## 🔍 Author's Main Issue / Thesis

• **Concentration as Fundamental Principle**: The author posits that the fundamental principle of air strategy is concentration, requiring the deployment of the maximum force, moral, physical, and material, at the decisive time and place. This is enabled by air power's inherent mobility and tactical flexibility, allowing forces to switch objectives rapidly and apply strength where it is most needed.

• **Primary Task of Air Striking Force**: The primary task of the air striking force in a land battle is to isolate the battlefield from enemy reinforcement and supply, disrupting their communications and logistical systems, such as railways and roads, far behind the front lines. This goes beyond mere reconnaissance or direct battlefield support.

• **Air Superiority as Means, Not End**: Air superiority is not the ultimate objective but a crucial means to an end. It is best achieved through a resolute offensive bombing campaign against the enemy's vital centers, which compels them to divert their air forces to a defensive, often ineffectual, role, reducing interference with friendly operations.

• **Obsolescence of Traditional Armies**: The book argues that traditional national armies, reliant on "man-power and shell-power," are becoming obsolete due to the immense vulnerability of their extended lines of communication and supply to modern air action. A single line of supply within hostile bombing range, for instance, would be a fatal disability.

• **Complementary Land and Air Operations**: The author stresses that land and air operations must be complementary and mutually interdependent, requiring deliberate and coordinated planning to maximize each service's potential. Air action should be designed to create opportunities for ground forces, for example, by hindering enemy reserves, thus helping to convert an initial "break-in" into a decisive "break-through."

• **Learning from Past Experience**: Slessor emphasizes that the recorded experience of past air operations, particularly from the last war, provides invaluable lessons for future commanders and staff officers. He seeks to draw useful conclusions on how "the new power of the air is likely to affect the problems of land warfare" to ensure commanders can "be wise before the event."

• **Constructive Analysis**: The book is not intended as destructive criticism but as a "reasoned attempt to examine some possibilities of air action in co-operation with an army in the field." It aims to suggest how things "might have been bettered" given the early air forces were "amateurs at a new art," applying contemporary knowledge to historical examples.

## 📒 Sections
## Introduction

### Key Commitments of the RAF
- The first and most important commitment of the Royal Air Force (RAF) is the **defence of Great Britain against air attack** [p. 3]
- Connected to this is providing an **air expeditionary force to cooperate with the army overseas** [p. 4]

### Understanding Air Power in Land Warfare
> It's crucial for officers of the army and air force to understand how air power affects land warfare, especially given the continued existence of large national forces with traditional arms [p. 4]

### Learning from WWI Experience
The author acknowledges drawing heavily on experience from the last war (1914-1918), admitting that some comments are **"wisdom after the event"** [p. 5]. The sole object is to **"draw conclusions on which to base useful lessons for the future"** [p. 6].

#### The Function of Military History
> The important function of military history is to enable future commanders and staff officers **"to be wise before the event, and to learn not only from the successes but from the failures of their predecessors"** [p. 6]

### Progress Since 1918
Since 1918, great progress has been made in air warfare [p. 8]:
- Technical efficiency is **"extremely high"**
- Training (especially weapon-training) is **"of a very high order"**
- Service manuals and training establishments contain **"the fruits of years of study and discussion on the strategy and tactics of air warfare"** [p. 8]

In the last war, commanders lacked these advantages, and the rapid growth of air forces, coupled with technical inadequacy and novelty of air warfare, meant they were not always used to **"the best advantage"** [p. 8].

### Addressing Criticism of Historical Lessons
A common criticism to anticipate is that modern developments have rendered lessons from 1914-1918 obsolete, arguing that trench warfare will **"never Be seen again"** [p. 9]. While this is true for specific trench warfare characteristics, the author cautions against assuming that **"military operations of any nature on the ground are, as yet, only a matter for the reminiscences of a modern generation of Old Kaspars"** [p. 10].

### British Defensive Policy and the Low Countries
British defensive policy highlights the primary importance of the Low Countries [p. 11]:
- Their freedom, historically vital for maritime security, is now also crucial for air security [p. 11]
- In air defence, **"a first essential is depth, because depth means time and space"** [p. 11]
- This allows fighters to reach height and bombers to establish forward aerodromes [p. 12]
- Although increasing bomber ranges will diminish this, intensive attacks on Britain could still be sustained from Channel coast bases [p. 12]

> Therefore, military operations on the ground—though different from 1914-1918—may again be necessary to **"ensure the integrity of the Low Countries, to prevent the establishment of hostile air bases within fatally close range of these coasts"** [p. 13]

### The Value of Studying WWI Air Operations
It is **"obviously worth while trying to learn something from a study of the only first-class war in which aircraft have played an important part"** [p. 13]. 

The author warns against two dangerous attitudes:
1. Assuming a future war will be exactly like the last
2. Assuming it will be so utterly different as to ignore all past lessons [p. 14]

### Historical Parallels
The interval between the South African War and the Great War showed failures (e.g., ammunition supply system based on South Africa) and achievements [p. 14, 15]. The 1914 campaign was **"nothing like as different as the next land operations are likely to be from those of 1918"** [p. 15].

### Fundamental Principles
The author stresses that the basic principles of war—**"merely the basic principles of common sense applied to war—do not change"** [p. 16]. Knowledge of past actions and results provides **"the best basis for sound judgement"** [p. 17]. 

The air force, with only one major war to draw upon, must study its operations to understand **"broad principles such as concentration, security, and offensive action"** [p. 17].

### Purpose of the Book
The book is written **"as a reasoned attempt to examine some possibilities of air action in co-operation with an army in the field, in the light of experience of the last Great War"** [p. 18]. It aims to suggest how operations might have been bettered with today's knowledge [p. 18].

### Envisaged Conditions
Conditions envisaged: a land campaign where the primary problem is **"the defeat of an enemy army in the field"** [p. 19]. The application of great principles varies with war conditions [p. 19]. In wars against a naval power or when the main threat is hostile air forces, the air force's objectives would differ [p. 20].

### Historical Research Challenges
Historical research is severely handicapped by a lack of comprehensive documentary records for air force operations in WWI [p. 20]. Liaison was primarily **"personal discussion and verbal instructions, usually unconfirmed in writing"** [p. 21]. This makes it difficult for historians to grasp the atmosphere in which decisions were made [p. 21].

### Technical Advances
Immense advances in aircraft performance and offensive power since WWI are noted, with **"still greater improvement both in speed and carrying capacity"** expected [p. 23]. Developments like heavy oil engines will **"mean a very great increase in bomber ranges in the near future, possibly by 100 per cent, or more"** [p. 24]. 

Overlooking increases in **"bombing accuracy and the efficiency of air armaments, of organization, and of training"** would give a **"very false picture of the potentialities of air warfare in modern conditions"** [p. 25].

# Part I: Air Superiority

## I. The Object

### National and Military Objectives
- The **"National object in war is to overcome the opponent's will"** by overcoming **"the armed forces or such of them as are capable of influencing the decision"** [p. 52]
- The object of an army in a land campaign is to **defeat the enemy's army** [p. 53]
- The object of the air force contingent in the field is to **"assist and co-operate with the army in the defeat of the enemy's army, and of such air forces as may be co-operating with it"** [p. 53]

### WWI Air Operations Context
WWI air operations were largely **"Army co-operation"** focused on reconnaissance [p. 54]. Up to the end of the war, the **"primary object of all air operations, with one exception, was to secure air superiority over the battle line, to enable our reconnaissance and artillery aircraft to carry on their work of close co-operation"** [p. 55]. The exception was the Independent Force, RAF [p. 55].

### The Importance of Air Striking Force
While close cooperation (Army Co-operation Squadrons) is important, the book emphasizes the positive influence of an air striking force in direct attack upon objectives on the ground [p. 56]. This aspect is **"still seriously underrated in the British Service to-day"** but **"may have an influence on the course of a campaign out of all proportion to that which can be exerted by the purely ancillary service of reconnaissance and observation"** [p. 57].

### Primary Objectives in Land Campaigns
In a land campaign, primary objectives are **"the enemy land forces, their communications and system of supply"** [p. 57].

A land campaign is defined as a campaign or stage where the **"primary object for the time being is the defeat of an enemy army in the field"** [p. 58]. This includes initial struggles for bases (e.g., in the Low Countries) to achieve air defence depth for Britain [p. 58, 59].

### Transition to Air Campaign
Once the army's objective is achieved, the ultimate reduction of the enemy nation **"may (and very likely will) be undertaken, not by the traditional methods of land invasion... but by air measures"** [p. 60]. At this point, it becomes an **"air campaign,"** and the army's task is **"simply to protect the air bases"** [p. 60]. Even then, direct action against **"hostile vital centres"** is more likely to be decisive than action against air forces alone [p. 61].

> Therefore, in a land campaign, **"all action other than against military objectives (as opposed to objectives connected with the enemy air force) is merely secondary"** [p. 61]

### Action Against Enemy Air Forces
However, action against enemy air forces and their supply system is essential for two main reasons:

1. **To enable "our own air offensive to be directed with the minimum of interference against the objectives best calculated to contribute to the primary aim"** [p. 62]
2. **To "protect our own army and its reconnaissance aircraft from hostile air interference"** [p. 62]

This makes action against enemy air forces **"a means to an end, an essential measure of security upon which all offensive action must be based"** [p. 62]. However, **"air fighting in itself, the destruction of enemy air forces, will not give us a decision in a land campaign"** [p. 63].

### Defining Air Superiority
The term **"air superiority"** is often a **"catchword"** leading to **"confusion of thought"** [p. 64]. The official definition is **"a state of moral, physical, and material superiority which enables its possessor to conduct operations against an enemy and at the same time deprive the enemy of the ability to interfere effectively by the use of his own air forces"** [p. 65].

- This means **"the capacity to achieve our own object in the air and to stop the enemy achieving his"** [p. 65]
- Analogous to sea supremacy, the object of air superiority is control of air communications: **"firstly for our own use and secondly to deny their use to the enemy"** [p. 66]

Due to the **"cubic area of the battle-fields,"** absolute air command is **"hardly ever practicable"** [p. 67].

### Methods of Securing Air Superiority
The surest method of securing freedom of action in the air is the destruction of the enemy's air forces [p. 67]. Even then, it only limits interference, achieved through **"hard and continuous fighting"** [p. 68].

In both sea and air warfare, battle with enemy forces is only the means, not the end (**"the Method, not the Intention"**) [p. 68]. Confusing this can lead to strategic errors, as seen in Mr. Winston Churchill's 1917 memorandum which stated the **"primary objective"** of air forces was **"the air bases of the enemy and the consequent destruction of his air fighting forces"** [p. 69]. The author points out the confusion between **"objective"** and **"purpose"** [p. 70].

### The Role of Fighter Aircraft
For fighter aircraft alone, destruction of enemy aircraft **"may be said to be the primary objective"** [p. 70]. However, fighters are **"only one arm of the air forces"** [p. 71]. Their influence is **"entirely indirect and auxiliary"** [p. 74], but **"No mistake could be more destructive in its consequences than to underrate the value of pursuit aviation to air operations as a whole"** [p. 74].

### Foch's Understanding
Marshal Foch correctly understood the relation between air fighting and the true object in 1918 [p. 75]. His plans for the Inter-Allied Bombing Force aimed at **"dislocation of German war industry and munition supply"** [p. 75]. Sir Hugh Trenchard, commanding the force, was given freedom to neutralize enemy air forces to enable his squadrons to carry out this primary mission [p. 76, 77]. This reinforces: **"Method, not Intention"** [p. 77].

### Army vs Air Force Objectives
The apparent divergence between army and air force objectives is **"more apparent than real"** and **"mainly a matter of degree"** [p. 78]. The airman **"strikes direct at those objectives"** (enemy country/LoC) because, within tactical range, the air force is **"independent of lines of communication and has no flanks"** [p. 79]. 

An army cannot ignore hostile forces and forge straight ahead; an air force can reach objectives, **"do its job, and get back again without the preliminary total defeat of the corresponding hostile armed forces"** [p. 81].

### Strategic Flexibility of Air Forces
Another important strategic difference is that an air force **"is not committed to any one course of action"** [p. 82]. Unlike land forces, which incur **"great dislocation and delay"** with fundamental plan alterations due to their slow movement and **"elaborate and cumbrous administrative machinery"** [p. 82, 83], an air force **"can switch, literally almost at a moment's notice, from one objective to another several hundred miles away, from the same base"** [p. 84]. Sound organization and inexpensive aerodromes also allow base changes with minimum dislocation [p. 85].

### Maintaining Air Superiority
Air superiority is not a definite condition achieved once and for all [p. 86]. It is **"not a phase to be gone through, a necessary preliminary... before the real business can begin"** [p. 86]. It must be **"constantly maintained by striking direct at those objectives which are of first importance to the enemy at the time"** [p. 87]. 

> **"The struggle for air superiority is part and parcel of all air operations against a first-class enemy"** [p. 87]

Its moral factor is secured by **"an instant and unremitting offensive directed against the primary objective"** [p. 88].
