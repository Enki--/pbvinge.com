# See It/Shoot It

## Online Description

An illuminating study tracing the evolution of drone technology and counterterrorism policy from the Reagan to the Obama administrations This eye-opening study uncovers the history of the most important instrument of U.S. counterterrorism today: the armed drone. It reveals that, contrary to popular belief, the CIA’s covert drone program is not a product of 9/11. Rather, it is the result of U.S. counterterrorism practices extending back to an influential group of policy makers in the Reagan administration. Tracing the evolution of counterterrorism policy and drone technology from the fallout of Iran-Contra and the CIA’s “Eagle Program” prototype in the mid-1980s to the emergence of al-Qaeda, Fuller shows how George W. Bush and Obama built upon or discarded strategies from the Reagan and Clinton eras as they responded to changes in the partisan environment, the perceived level of threat, and technological advances. Examining a range of counterterrorism strategies, he reveals why the CIA’s drones became the United States’ preferred tool for pursuing the decades-old goal of preemptively targeting anti-American terrorists around the world.
  
## **🔫 Author Background**

  

Christopher J. Fuller is an Associate Professor (Reader) in Modern U.S. History at the University of Southampton, specializing in American foreign policy, terrorism/counterterrorism, and security studies. His research focuses on how technology, intelligence, and law interact in U.S. responses to terrorism, from the Cold War to the post‑9/11 era. He has published on U.S. cyber (in)security and the broader security implications of the Internet, using “applied history” to inform contemporary policy debates. See It/Shoot It is his major monograph on drones and the CIA, drawing heavily on declassified documents, congressional hearings, legal scholarship, and investigative journalism.

## **🔍 Author’s Main Issue / Thesis**

  

Fuller’s central claim is that the CIA’s lethal drone campaign is not a radical post‑9/11 innovation but the culmination of a decades‑long search for a “see it/shoot it” capability against terrorists—an incremental convergence of technology, legal authority, and political will. He argues that since NSDD 138 (1984), U.S. presidents have treated terrorism as a national‑security threat warranting preemptive lethal force anywhere in the world, including in states “unable or unwilling” to deal with terrorists on their territory (a logic later used for drones).  The drone campaign thus marks a _return_ to, not a departure from, Reagan‑era counterterrorism ideas. Fuller contends that drones have been tactically and operationally effective at decapitating al‑Qaeda’s core and denying safe havens, but they have not ended the broader jihadist movement. Finally, he highlights how a “covert action pendulum”—oscillations between enthusiasm for CIA paramilitary action and backlash against it—shaped both the adoption and the constraints of lethal drones.

## **🧭 One‑Paragraph Overview**

  

See It/Shoot It traces how the United States moved from the Reagan administration’s rhetorical “war on terrorism” to the CIA’s highly routinized drone campaign in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Fuller shows that lessons from failed proxy operations (Fadlallah), fraught alliance politics (Achille Lauro), and imprecise tools (cruise missiles, proxy militias, renditions, JSOC raids) gradually pushed U.S. policymakers toward a persistent, precise, and legally rationalized tool for targeting terrorists at distance. He follows the institutional story of the CIA’s Counterterrorism Center (CTC) from the 1980s “Radio Shack solution” (Eagle Program) through Amber/GNAT and Predator to Obama’s surge in drone strikes. Along the way, Fuller reconstructs the evolving legal architecture that reinterpreted assassination bans and self‑defense, the interagency fights over risk and responsibility, and the political calculus that made drones appear “the only game in town” by 2009. He then evaluates the effectiveness and unintended consequences of the drone campaign, arguing it succeeded in degrading al‑Qaeda’s core and aiding the Afghan war effort, but had limited impact on the wider jihadist movement and raised profound accountability and proliferation issues.

## **🎯 Course Themes Tracker**

- **Limits on airpower:** Legal bans on assassination, sovereignty concerns, alliance politics, intelligence constraints, basing access (Pakistan), and organizational “covert action pendulum” all restrict how drones can be used.
    
- **Expectations vs. reality:** Leaders expected precise surgical decapitation and political low‑cost; reality included persistent legal ambiguity, civilian casualties, adversary adaptation, and partial strategic success.
    
- **Adaptation & learning:** U.S. shifts from proxies and cruise missiles to drones, refines ROE (e.g., signature vs. personality strikes), and rebalances CIA between paramilitary and analytic roles. Adversaries adapt through dispersal, communications discipline, and changes in leadership structures.
    
- **Efficacy (tactical → political):** Tactically lethal and operationally useful (denial of safe haven, force protection), but strategically insufficient to end the “War on Terror” or prevent diffusion of jihadist violence.
    
- **Alliance/coalition dynamics:** Italian and Egyptian reactions in Achille Lauro, Pakistani cooperation/deniability and domestic politics, NATO reliance on CIA drones for cross‑border fires.
    
- **Domain interplay:** Airpower (manned aircraft, cruise missiles) evolves into unmanned platforms; drones depend on space‑enabled ISR/C2 (satellite links, GPS) and dense intel networks; CIA/JSOC/USAF integration is central.
    

---

## **🔑 Top Takeaways**

- The CIA’s drone campaign is best understood as the realization of a long‑standing U.S. desire for a “see it/shoot it” option against terrorists, not as an ad hoc technological seduction after 9/11. 
    
- Legal reinterpretations—especially of EO 12333’s assassination ban and Article 51 self‑defense—were as crucial as technological advances in enabling lethal drones.
    
- Negative experiences with proxies, renditions, and large‑footprint military interventions (Iraq, detention, torture) made drones the comparatively “least bad” CT tool by the late 2000s.
    
- Operationally, drones substantially decimated al‑Qaeda’s core leadership and denied safe haven in AfPak, while also providing close support and force protection for ISAF in otherwise inaccessible areas.
    
- Strategically, the campaign’s success against al‑Qaeda core coincided with the diffusion and growth of a broader, decentralized jihadist movement, underlining the limits of decapitation and airpower alone.
    
- The “covert action pendulum” ensures that CIA paramilitary effectiveness comes with recurring political and oversight crises; drones intensified debates about accountability, transparency, and Title 50 vs. Title 10.
    
- As technology diffuses, drones shift from being a niche U.S. advantage to a widely available tool—potentially used by rivals and nonstate actors in hybrid warfare, posing new threats to U.S. forces and societies.

### **A Note on Language**

  

**Summary:**

Fuller explains his terminology, aware that words like “terrorist,” “collateral damage,” and “drone” carry political and moral weight. He chooses “AfPak” as a term of art used by U.S. officials to signal the perceived strategic unity of the Afghanistan‑Pakistan theater while acknowledging that it masks important regional differences. He retains “collateral damage” to match official sources but clarifies it refers to civilian casualties, not a morally neutral category. “Drone” is used instead of “UAV” or “UAS” because it is widely recognized in public discourse, though he recognizes its imprecision. Fuller’s language choices aim to mirror the policy world he studies while remaining explicit about their normative implications. 

  

**Key Points:**

- “AfPak” reflects U.S. strategic framing—helpful analytically but potentially flattening local distinctions.
    
- “Collateral damage” is used as official jargon for civilian casualties, not to sanitize harm.
    
- “Drone” is preferred for clarity with general readers despite technical objections.
    
- Fuller flags that language influences how we perceive legitimacy and necessity of targeted killing.
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Legal/Normative limits:** How naming shapes what is perceived as lawful or acceptable.
    
- **Expectations vs. reality:** Terms like “surgical strike” can obscure messy on‑the‑ground effects.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Legal/Normative:** Contest over whether terms like “targeted killing” or “assassination” apply; this underpins legal arguments about drones.
    
- **Information:** Media and official language can obscure or highlight civilian harm, affecting domestic tolerance for airpower in CT.
    
- **Political:** Terminological framing (e.g., “war on terror” vs. “law enforcement”) conditions what options seem available to policymakers.

### **List of Abbreviations**

  

**Summary:**

The abbreviations section catalogues the alphabet soup of agencies, legal instruments, and technologies that populate U.S. CT policy and its drone program. It covers organizations such as CTC, JSOC, DoD, ISI, and legal references like EO 12333, NSDD 138, and PDD 39, alongside platforms like Predator, Reaper, Amber, and GNAT.  This signals from the outset that Fuller’s story sits at the intersection of law, intelligence, and airpower technology. The dense list itself is an artifact of the bureaucratic complexity that shapes CT decision‑making. For SAASS purposes, it doubles as a quick reference for the institutional and doctrinal environment in which drones were adopted.

  

**Key Points:**

- Highlights the multitude of actors (CIA, JSOC, State, NSC, ISI) involved in CT and airpower policy.
    
- Shows the importance of specific legal instruments (EO 12333, NSDD 138, PDD 39, AUMF).
    
- Identifies key platforms and programs (Eagle Program, Amber, Predator, Reaper).
    
- Implies that CT airpower is fundamentally a bureaucratic _system of systems_, not a single platform choice.
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Domain interplay:** Air, space, ISR/C2, and legal authorities are entangled.
    
- **Operational limits:** Every acronym maps to a constraint or enabling mechanism for CT air operations.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Operational:** Multiple agencies with distinct authorities complicate unity of command over drone operations.
    
- **Strategic:** Legal authorities (NSDD, PDDs, AUMF) both empower and constrain CT airpower.
    
- **Information:** Acronym‑laden systems risk stovepipes and misunderstanding between military, intelligence, and political leadership.

### **Prologue: “Let Him Sleep”**

  

**Summary:**

Fuller opens with the May 21, 2010 drone strike in Boyya, North Waziristan, that killed Mustafa Abu al‑Yazid, al‑Qaeda’s “number three,” together with his wife, three daughters, and granddaughter. He reconstructs the decision‑making chain from CIA CTC analysts and their wall of photographs commemorating colleagues killed at Khost, through the remote crew guiding an M‑model Hellfire, to Pakistani media reports that initially emphasized civilian deaths.  The prologue juxtaposes high‑tech “see it/shoot it” targeting with the visceral image of bodies in the rubble, highlighting the human, political, and moral stakes of remote warfare. Fuller then traces how Western media shifted from near‑silence on the strike to treating al‑Yazid’s death as vindication of drones, and finally to more critical accounts of civilian harm. He argues that amid debates about legality, blowback, and effectiveness, one basic question remained underexplored: how did the CIA acquire the ability, authority, and inclination to conduct such lethal drone operations in the first place?  That question motivates the book.

  

**Key Points:**

- Boyya strike exemplifies the promise and controversy of precision remote lethal force.
    
- CTC’s internal culture (Khost memorial wall) shapes how analysts perceive risk, vengeance, and necessity.
    
- Media narratives move from under‑reporting, to triumphalism, to concern over civilians.
    
- The prologue reframes the debate: before arguing “for” or “against” drones, we must understand their historical and institutional origins.
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Limits on airpower:** Intelligence uncertainty, collateral damage, and political visibility.
    
- **Efficacy:** Tactical success (HVT killed) vs. strategic/political costs (civilian casualties, Pakistani outrage).
    
- **Writing contemporary history:** Reliance on leaked reports and media coverage to reconstruct classified operations.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Intelligence/Information:** Imperfect ground truth about who is in the target building; competing casualty counts from different sources.
    
- **Legal/Normative:** Questions about assassination, civilian protection, and Pakistan’s sovereignty.
    
- **Political:** U.S. non‑acknowledgment vs. Pakistani domestic backlash and international scrutiny.
    
- **Adversary Adaptation:** al‑Qaeda’s later attempt to control information (delaying confirmation of al‑Yazid’s death) reflects awareness of media dynamics.

### **Introduction: “The True Watersheds in Human Affairs Are Seldom Spotted”**

  

**Summary:**

Fuller challenges the conventional view of 9/11 as an absolute “break” in U.S. counterterrorism policy, arguing instead for long‑term continuity. He surveys journalistic and legal critiques of the CIA drone program—focused on legality, civilian casualties, secrecy, and blowback—and notes that most analyses treat drones as a novel, technologically driven phenomenon.  Against this, he introduces the “covert action pendulum”: a cyclical pattern in which enthusiasm for aggressive CIA action leads to scandal and retrenchment (e.g., Church Committee, Iran‑Contra), only for pressures from new threats to push policy back toward covert lethality.  The introduction outlines the book’s core argument that the drone campaign is the embodiment of a long‑standing desire for a “see it/shoot it option,” made possible by incremental advances in technology and law rather than a sudden post‑9/11 epiphany. Fuller explicitly positions his work as applied history, engaging contemporary legal and ethical debates while grounding them in a detailed institutional narrative. He previews each chapter, showing how Reagan‑era initiatives, failed operations, and the evolution of CTC and UAV technology laid the groundwork for Obama’s drone surge.

  

**Key Points:**

- Critiques dominant narratives that depict drones as a post‑9/11 technological revolution.
    
- Introduces “covert action pendulum” as a framework for understanding CIA operations.
    
- Argues drones realize Richard Clarke’s “see it/shoot it option” against terrorists. 
    
- Maps out the structure: Reagan rhetoric, Fadlallah/Achille Lauro, CTC/Eagle–Predator, Clinton legal architecture, alternative CT tools, and Obama’s drone campaign.
    
- Highlights methodological challenges—secrecy, contested casualty data, and reliance on NGOs and investigative journalists.
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Expectations vs. reality:** Drones look fundamentally new but are rooted in long‑term strategic desires.
    
- **Limits on airpower:** Legal ambiguity (assassination vs. self‑defense), Title 10 vs. Title 50, and congressional oversight deficits.
    
- **Adaptation & learning:** Policy evolution is slow, path‑dependent, and shaped by scandal as much as threat perception.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Legal/Normative:** EO 11905 and 12333 assassination bans, Article 51, and IHL constrain CT airpower and require reinterpretation before drones can be used.
    
- **Political:** Congressional secrecy constraints and limited oversight enable, but also threaten, the legitimacy of drone campaigns.
    
- **Information:** Public debates rely on partial strike and casualty data (Bureau of Investigative Journalism, New America Foundation). 
    
- **Strategic:** “War on Terror” against a tactic/abstraction makes measuring success and end‑states inherently difficult.

### **Chapter 1: “The Hamlet of Nations”: The Rhetoric and Reality of the Reagan Administration’s Counterterrorism Policy, 1980–1985**

  

**Summary:**

Fuller examines the Reagan administration’s proclaimed “war on terrorism,” centered on rhetoric likening U.S. indecision to “the Hamlet of nations,” and finds a stark gap between words and deeds. Secretary of State George Shultz, DCI William Casey, and NSC staffer Oliver North form a “counterterrorism hardliner” camp that views terrorism as an existential national‑security threat requiring proactive, even lethal, measures.  They push for NSDD 138 (1984), which designates terrorism as a national‑security threat and authorizes preemptive use of force worldwide, including in states “unable or unwilling” to act—foreshadowing later drone justifications. Yet internal resistance from Secretary of Defense Weinberger, the Joint Chiefs, and a risk‑averse NSC yields disjointed operations rather than a coherent strategy. Fuller shows that Reagan’s administration lays the legal and rhetorical foundations for later targeted killing even as practical implementation falters. He argues that this period inaugurates the long‑term framing of terrorism as a quasi‑war problem, making airpower and covert force thinkable as routine tools.

  

**Key Points:**

- Reagan’s rhetoric (“war on terrorism”) far outpaces his administration’s actual willingness to use force.
    
- NSDD 138 authorizes preemptive lethal force worldwide and advances an “unable or unwilling” doctrine.
    
- Hardliners (Shultz, Casey, North) push a war‑paradigm; Weinberger and JCS emphasize prudence and conventional missions.
    
- Internal dysfunction and ad hocism prevent coherent execution of preemptive policy.
    
- Early debates over assassination, self‑defense, and IHL anticipate later drone legal arguments.
    
- The CIA is “unleashed” rhetorically but still constrained by law and interagency politics. 
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Limits on airpower:** DoD reluctance to assume CT mission; legal ban on assassination; fear of escalation with state sponsors.
    
- **Expectations vs. reality:** Promised decisive retaliation devolves into episodic, often symbolic, actions.
    
- **Learning:** NSDD 138 codifies concepts (preemption, global reach) that later underpin drone doctrine.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Political (endogenous):** Interagency divisions—Weinberger vs. Shultz/Casey—make consistent use of force difficult; partially adjustable via presidential leadership but never fully resolved.
    
- **Legal/Normative (exogenous/endogenous):** EO 12333 and assassination norms constrain CT strikes; legal work‑arounds (self‑defense, “terrorists as unlawful combatants”) emerge but remain controversial.
    
- **Operational:** Limited ISR, basing, and precision munitions cap the feasibility of preemptive strikes in terrorist sanctuaries.
    
- **Intelligence/Information:** Patchy HUMINT and SIGINT create high risk of misidentification, reinforcing DoD caution.

### **Chapter 2: “Let’s Find a Way to Go after Them”: The Fadlallah Affair and the Achille Lauro Hijacking, 1985**

  

**Summary:**

Fuller uses two 1985 crises—the failed car‑bomb assassination attempt against Lebanese cleric Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah and the Achille Lauro hijacking—to show how early CT practice shaped later preferences for drones. In the Fadlallah affair, CIA‑linked Lebanese proxies allegedly plant a massive car bomb near his Beirut residence, killing around eighty civilians while failing to kill the target.  The operation prompts public outrage, questions about CIA involvement, and internal soul‑searching about the risks of outsourcing lethal CT to unreliable local agents. In the Achille Lauro case, U.S. forces force down an Egyptian airliner carrying hijackers, only to face a jurisdictional clash with Italy over custody and trial—revealing alliance friction and divergent legal frameworks (terrorists as criminals vs. enemy combatants).  Fuller argues these episodes taught U.S. officials that proxies and extraterritorial snatches carry high political and legal risk, making them search for tools that are both more precise and more controllable. These lessons later increase the appeal of U.S.-controlled, precise, deniable airpower like UAVs.

  

**Key Points:**

- Fadlallah car bombing demonstrates the danger of proxy operations: mass civilian casualties, target survival, and deniable yet politically costly U.S. involvement.
    
- Achille Lauro exposes alliance tensions, competing legal regimes, and the limits of unilateral CT action in cooperative environments.
    
- Both cases reveal a mismatch between hardline CT aspirations and available tools.
    
- CIA learns to distrust proxies for lethal targeting and to value precise, U.S.-controlled means.
    
- Legal disputes over jurisdiction and custody foreshadow later debates on renditions and targeted killing.
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Adversary adaptation & sanctuary:** Terrorists exploit complex legal and political environments (Lebanon’s chaos; maritime/third‑country travel).
    
- **Limits on airpower:** Absence of precise, low‑visibility tools pushes reliance on messy alternatives.
    
- **Learning:** Hard lessons from proxy and alliance blowback push later preference for drones and more controllable CT instruments.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Legal/Normative (exogenous):** International law on sovereignty and due process constrains state‑sponsored assassination and forced renditions; only partially adjustable.
    
- **Political (exogenous/endogenous):** Italian and Lebanese domestic politics limit U.S. freedom of action; blowback from Fadlallah affair discourages overt proxy terror.
    
- **Operational:** Limited capability for long‑range, precise strikes and weak control over proxies produce high collateral damage and strategic embarrassment.
    
- **Intelligence:** Reliance on local informants with dubious motives contributes to mis‑targeting and incorrect threat assessments.

### **Chapter 3: “We Have to Find a Better Way to Send a Message”: The CIA’s Counterterrorism Center, from the Eagle Program to the Predator Drone, 1986–2001**

  

**Summary:**

This chapter traces the creation and evolution of the CIA’s Counterterrorism Center (CTC) and its pursuit of unmanned platforms from the 1980s Eagle Program to the Predator by 2001. Under Duane “Dewey” Clarridge, CTC becomes a hub for proactive CT operations, including an early “Radio Shack solution” concept—a small, remotely piloted vehicle potentially capable of delivering ordnance.  Fuller details how Clarridge’s aggressive approach culminates in Iran‑Contra, prompting backlash and feeding the covert action pendulum. Parallel to this institutional story runs a technological one: DARPA‑funded Amber, General Atomics’ GNAT, and USAF’s troubled Aquila program gradually mature UAV capability.  The CIA experiments with GNAT over the Balkans (Operation Lofty View), forging ties with Big Safari and demonstrating the operational utility of persistent ISR. By the late 1990s, Predator provides real‑time video of Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan but remains unarmed due to unresolved legal and organizational issues about whether the CIA can employ lethal force via UAVs. Only after 9/11—following a stalled September 4, 2001 Principals Committee discussion—does the Bush administration authorize armed Predators under a sweeping covert action finding.  Fuller stresses that the technical ability to arm drones preceded the political willingness to use them lethally.

  

**Key Points:**

- CTC is set up to centralize CT operations and intelligence, with an early interest in unmanned strike options (Eagle Program).
    
- The Iran‑Contra scandal triggers oversight and mistrust, slowing CIA paramilitary initiatives.
    
- Amber/GNAT demonstrate long‑endurance ISR; Aquila’s failure pushes DoD to reconsider UAVs.
    
- Predator enables near‑continuous surveillance of bin Laden pre‑9/11 but remains unarmed, revealing the primacy of legal/political limits over technological ones.
    
- Armed Predator tests in early 2001 show feasibility; unresolved questions about assassination and CIA’s role delay operational use.
    
- Post‑9/11 findings dramatically expand CIA lethal authorities, bringing the pre‑existing “see it/shoot it” aspiration within reach.
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Technological vs. political limits:** Technology matures faster than legal and organizational willingness to employ it.
    
- **Institutional learning:** CTC builds networks of analysts, tech specialists, and foreign informants central to later drone campaign.
    
- **Domain interplay:** Integration of ISR (UAV feeds, satellites, HUMINT) with precision strike capacity is foundational.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Technological (endogenous):** Early UAVs suffer from reliability, bandwidth, and endurance issues; gradually addressed through R&D and Big Safari’s rapid acquisition methods.
    
- **Legal/Normative (endogenous):** CIA lawyers debate whether using armed UAVs constitutes assassination; the issue remains unresolved until post‑9/11 re‑interpretations.
    
- **Operational:** Coordination between CIA and USAF over basing, C2, and airspace management; multi‑agency friction over who “owns” UAV capability.
    
- **Political:** Iran‑Contra hangover reduces presidential and congressional tolerance for bold covert action, delaying more aggressive UAV use.

### **Chapter 4: “Talking about Capturing bin Laden”: The Clinton Administration and the Legal Architecture of Lethal Force in Counterterrorism, 1993–2000**

  

**Summary:**

Fuller challenges the narrative that the Clinton administration was “soft” on terrorism, showing instead that it built much of the legal architecture later used for lethal drones while remaining cautious about risk and collateral damage. PDD 39 and later directives place terrorism at the top of national‑security concerns, authorize renditions, and endorse limited uses of force.  Clinton repeatedly authorizes cruise missile strikes (e.g., against al‑Qaeda after the 1998 embassy bombings) but is constrained by intelligence uncertainty, fears of civilian casualties, and sensitivity to political optics (“wag the dog”). Meanwhile, CIA lawyers and NSC officials reinterpret EO 12333 and international law to distinguish “assassination” from lawful self‑defense against terrorists engaged in ongoing armed attacks.  Findings concerning bin Laden articulate “capture if feasible, kill if necessary,” a formulation later mirrored in Obama‑era drone policy. Fuller situates these debates within a broader spectrum of U.S. grand‑strategy schools (assertive nationalists vs. liberal internationalists), showing how different camps weighed law, risk, and morality. The chapter ends with the picture of a legal framework ready to support targeted killing, even if cruise missiles and proxies remain the primary tools for action.

  

**Key Points:**

- Clinton elevates CT but prefers cruise missiles and proxies, wary of casualties and legality.
    
- Legal advisers craft interpretations of self‑defense and “ongoing armed conflict” that allow lethal targeting of terrorists without violating assassination bans.
    
- “Capture/kill” language and CT findings anticipate later drone strike authorizations.
    
- Clinton’s caution leads to several missed opportunities against bin Laden, highlighting operational and intelligence limits.
    
- The “covert action pendulum” still swings toward restraint due to Iran‑Contra and broader distrust of CIA paramilitary action.
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Legal/Normative limits:** Law is not just a constraint but an enabling framework; once reinterpreted, it legitimates future drone strikes.
    
- **Efficacy:** Cruise missiles and proxies are blunt instruments with limited flexibility against mobile, dispersed targets.
    
- **Learning:** The Clinton years codify legal doctrines that later allow CIA to use drones in non‑battlefield settings.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Legal/Normative (endogenous):** Assassination bans, IHL, and UN Charter Article 51 require careful re‑interpretation; adjustable but slowly and politically costly.
    
- **Operational:** Cruise missile flight times, launch constraints, and target movement limit the ability to exploit fleeting intelligence.
    
- **Intelligence:** Coarse targeting data and dependence on proxies make bin Laden “capture/kill” operations exceedingly risky.
    
- **Political:** Domestic scandal (Lewinsky) and fear of “wag the dog” accusations shape willingness to use force.

### **Chapter 5: “Ninja Guys in Black Suits”: Alternative Counterterrorism Tools, 1993–2008**

  

**Summary:**

Before drones become central, the U.S. relies heavily on alternative CT tools: renditions, black sites (GREYSTONE), JSOC raids, and expanded NSA surveillance. Fuller shows how these methods—while sometimes effective—carry severe legal, moral, and political costs that eventually render them politically toxic. The romanticized idea of “ninja guys in black suits” conducting clean snatch operations repeatedly collides with messy reality: jurisdictional disputes, intelligence failures, and the problem of indefinite detention.  The post‑9/11 Bush years see an expansion of JSOC and CIA paramilitary activities, including controversial detention and interrogation practices, which generate intense domestic and international backlash. As Obama enters office, he confronts a CT toolkit dominated by rendition and detention practices he has pledged to roll back, yet still faces pressure to neutralize terrorists overseas. Fuller argues that drones appear attractive partly because they promise to neutralize threats without new detainees or large troop deployments—making them a politically “cleaner” successor to earlier tools.

  

**Key Points:**

- Rendition and black sites provide a non‑airpower CT tool but become politically and legally unsustainable.
    
- JSOC raids and special operations remain risky, resource‑intensive, and often dependent on host‑nation cooperation.
    
- NSA surveillance underpins both raids and drone strikes, but raises its own civil‑liberties controversies.
    
- Obama’s desire to close Guantánamo and curb torture creates a CT “gap” that drones help fill.
    
- Drones become “the only game in town” partly because other CT options have been delegitimized or constrained.
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Limits on airpower:** Earlier ground‑centric CT tools set the political context that makes airpower (drones) preferable.
    
- **Adaptation:** CIA and JSOC adapt from capture/detain to kill‑focused CT as legal and political space for detention shrinks.
    
- **Efficacy:** Drones promise fewer U.S. casualties and no detainees, but shift the burden to questions of civilian harm and sovereignty.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Legal/Normative (exogenous/endogenous):** Torture, indefinite detention, and renditions provoke legal challenges and norm backlash; over time, these practices become politically untenable.
    
- **Political:** Domestic and allied outrage narrows the menu of CT instruments available to presidents.
    
- **Operational:** Host‑nation basing, complex raids, and detainee handling limit number and scope of JSOC operations.
    
- **Resource/Time:** Sustaining a global detention and interrogation architecture is expensive and politically draining, driving interest in “lighter” tools like drones.

### **Chapter 6: “The Only Game in Town”: The Strategy and Effectiveness of the CIA’s Lethal Drone Campaign, 2009–2012**

  

**Summary:**

Fuller evaluates the strategy and effectiveness of the CIA’s drone campaign in AfPak under Obama, organizing his analysis around three main objectives: (1) decapitation of al‑Qaeda’s leadership, (2) denial of safe haven, and (3) force protection for ISAF forces.  Drawing on the literature on leadership decapitation (Pape, Jordan, Price, Johnston), he notes scholarly skepticism but emphasizes that empirical work suggests decapitation can increase the odds of government success by roughly 25–30 percent when integrated into broader strategies.  Fuller finds that drone strikes—killing around sixty‑five senior leaders and between 1,853 and 3,032 militants from 2004–2016—have “decimated al‑Qaeda’s core leadership in South Asia,” a judgment echoed by U.S. officials and al‑Qaeda’s own laments.  Persistent drone presence also psychologically and physically constrains al‑Qaeda, suffocating its ability to move, meet, and recruit.  Mapping of strikes by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism shows that entire zones became effectively off‑limits, supporting a safe‑haven denial strategy and aiding ISAF operations in Afghanistan by targeting Taliban networks beyond the reach of ground troops.  Fuller then examines blowback arguments and civilian harm, noting divergent assessments: critics claim social fabric destruction, while local activists and the 2012 Peshawar Declaration sometimes endorse drone strikes as the most acceptable counter‑militancy tool.  He concludes that, judged against Obama’s narrow operational objectives in AfPak, the campaign was a tactical and operational success—but its contribution to ending the broader “War on Terror” is doubtful as jihadist violence diffused elsewhere.

  

**Key Points:**

- Objective 1: Leadership decapitation—substantial attrition of al‑Qaeda core; supported by official and jihadist sources.
    
- Objective 2: Denial of safe haven—strike patterns and militant behavior suggest key FATA areas became no‑go zones for al‑Qaeda and Taliban.
    
- Objective 3: Force protection—drones support NATO by hitting militants in Pakistani sanctuaries that ISAF soldiers cannot reach.
    
- Civilian casualties decline over time as experience, safeguards, and refined targeting methods improve accuracy; Obama tightens rules compared to Bush’s signature‑strike practices. 
    
- Local attitudes are mixed; some see drones as threats to social cohesion, others see them as preferable to Pakistani military operations or Taliban rule.
    
- Despite successes in AfPak, global jihadist violence increases, driven by events beyond CTC’s remit (Arab Spring, Syrian civil war, IS rise).
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Efficacy:** Strong tactical/operational payoffs (HVT attrition, safe‑haven denial, force protection); unclear or negative strategic outcome regarding overall jihadist movement.
    
- **Limits on airpower:** Drones cannot build governance, fix Pakistani politics, or address root causes of radicalization.
    
- **Adaptation & learning:** CIA refines targeting, reduces civilian casualties, and builds a sophisticated intelligence–strike apparatus; jihadists adapt by dispersing, concealing, and shifting theaters.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Political (exogenous/endogenous):** Pakistani sovereignty concerns, domestic anti‑U.S. sentiment, and U.S. casualty sensitivity shape campaign tempo and secrecy.
    
- **Legal/Normative:** Tension between Title 50 (covert CIA operations) and expectations of transparency/oversight for the use of force; partially relieved through public speeches (Brennan, Holder) and later policy guidelines.
    
- **Operational:** Basing and overflight (e.g., Pakistani cooperation), weather, and ISR bandwidth constrain persistent presence.
    
- **Intelligence/Information:** Targeting relies on network of local agents (pathrai beacons) and pattern‑of‑life analysis, susceptible to error and manipulation.
    
- **Adversary Adaptation:** Jihadist communications discipline, movement from FATA to other theaters, and organizational diffusion limit what decapitation can achieve.

### **Conclusion: “It Sends Its Bloodhounds Everywhere”**

  

**Summary:**

The conclusion situates the CIA’s drone campaign within a broader historical arc of empires extending coercive power across borders and anticipates a future of widespread drone proliferation. Fuller argues that U.S. drones have effectively functioned as “bloodhounds” hunting threats in spaces otherwise inaccessible to American forces, embodying the long‑sought “weapon that would allow [the U.S.] to strike at targets in places it could not otherwise reach.”  At the same time, he warns that technological diffusion is eroding the U.S. monopoly: states like China and Russia, and nonstate actors, are already integrating drones into hybrid warfare and terror campaigns. He documents early incidents—activists crashing a drone near Angela Merkel, unauthorized flights over French nuclear plants, and a wayward quadcopter landing on the White House lawn—as harbingers of broader security challenges.  Fuller revisits his core thesis: since NSDD 138, successive presidents have sought to neutralize terrorist threats through preemptive force; drones are simply the most refined tool for that long‑standing strategy, not evidence of a fundamentally new policy.  He ends by noting that drones, like nuclear technology and the Internet, will have dual uses—capable of both violence and beneficial civilian applications—and that the key challenge will be how states regulate and adapt to their ubiquity.

  

**Key Points:**

- Drones realize a decades‑old U.S. quest for long‑range, precise, low‑risk coercive tools.
    
- The CIA drone campaign in AfPak is a _continuity_ of Reagan‑era CT thinking, not a rupture.
    
- Technological diffusion makes it inevitable that rivals and nonstate actors will use drones, including in hybrid warfare. 
    
- Drones will increasingly feature in domestic security debates and civilian life, complicating regulation and defense.
    
- Tactical success against al‑Qaeda core coexists with an expanding, geographically diffuse jihadist threat. 
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Domain interplay:** Airpower’s evolution into common, low‑cost robotics blurs lines between military and civilian, domestic and foreign.
    
- **Limits & proliferation:** U.S. efforts to control drones’ use will be constrained by global diffusion and imitation.
    
- **Strategic ambiguity:** Success in one theater may coexist with strategic drift in global CT posture.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Technological (exogenous):** Drone proliferation reduces U.S. relative advantage and introduces new vulnerability (U.S. forces and homeland).
    
- **Legal/Normative:** Lack of robust international norms on drone use risks escalation and normalization of cross‑border targeted killing.
    
- **Strategic:** To wage war on “terror” as an abstraction is arguably unachievable; drones cannot solve a strategy‑definition problem.

## **🧱 Limits Typology (case‑specific)**

  

**Political Limits**

- **Domestic casualty sensitivity & war‑weariness:** Obama’s “AfPak surge” pairs ground forces with drones to minimize U.S. casualties, maintaining public support longer than in Vietnam.
    
    - _Origin:_ Exogenous (public opinion), endogenous (elite expectations).
        
    - _Adjustability:_ Partially relaxable via narrative framing, but structurally persistent.
        
    - _Effect:_ Encourages shift from raids and large deployments toward remote airpower.
        
    
- **Host‑nation politics (Pakistan):** Islamabad publicly denounces strikes while privately enabling them; domestic anti‑Americanism and sovereignty narratives constrain strike profiles.
    
    - _Origin:_ Exogenous (Pakistani domestic politics, civil–military dynamics).
        
    - _Effect:_ Drives secrecy; shapes basing access and geographic scope of strikes.
        
    

  

**Legal/Normative Limits**

- **Assassination ban (EO 11905, 12333):** Initially blocks overt targeted killing; lawyers reinterpret CT strikes as self‑defense within ongoing armed conflict, not assassination.
    
    - _Origin:_ Endogenous; response to Church Committee and earlier CIA abuses.
        
    - _Adjustability:_ Relaxable through reinterpretation and presidential findings; politically costly.
        
    
- **International law (Article 51, IHL):** Requires justifying strikes in non‑battlefield states as collective or unilateral self‑defense; shapes arguments about “unable or unwilling” states.
    
    - _Effect level:_ Strategic; constrains where and how airpower is used for CT.
        
    

  

**Strategic Limits**

- **War on an abstraction:** Targeting “terror” or “extremism” lacks clear end state; decapitation and safe‑haven denial produce localized gains but not war termination.
    
    - _Origin:_ Endogenous conceptual choice by U.S. leaders.
        
    - _Adjustability:_ Requires reframing CT from “war” to finite political objectives—largely unrealized in the period Fuller covers.
        
    

  

**Operational Limits**

- **Basing and access:** Drone operations depend on airfields (e.g., Pakistani sites) and overflight rights; closures or political crises can abruptly curtail capacity.
    
- **ISR & C2 bandwidth:** Reliance on Ku‑band satellite links and limited orbits creates coverage gaps and latency issues, constraining the “persistent presence” ideal.
    
- **Joint integration:** CIA Title 50 operations run parallel to JSOC Title 10 activities, complicating unity of command and comprehensive campaign design.
    

  

**Technological/Capability Limits**

- **Early UAV reliability & payload:** Amber, GNAT, and early Predator models suffer reliability issues and limited payloads; only later do they become true hunter‑killers.
    
- **Precision vs. blast:** Hellfire missiles, especially thermobaric variants, are precise in aim but still generate lethal blast zones for nearby civilians. 
    

  

**Intelligence/Information Limits**

- **Reliance on HUMINT & pathrai beacons:** Local agents and beacons can misdirect strikes; analysts face “fog of people” problems in FATA.
    
- **Data overload & organizational focus:** Emphasis on CT and drone operations detracts from broader strategic warning (Arab Spring, Crimea, IS rise).
    

  

**Adversary Adaptation Limits**

- **Tactical adaptation:** Terrorists disperse, reduce signatures, and avoid electronic communications; they shift safe havens to regions beyond drone reach.
    
- **Organizational adaptation:** Shift from hierarchical “al‑Qaeda core” to diffuse franchises and IS‑like proto‑states undermines decapitation’s strategic leverage.
    

  

**Resource/Time Limits**

- **Sustaining orbits & campaigns:** Drone campaigns are cheaper than large wars but still resource‑intensive; long‑term focus on AfPak strains CIA’s global analytic bandwidth.
    
- **Political patience:** Even low‑casualty, low‑visibility campaigns must show progress; this pressures metrics (HVTs killed) that may not map to strategic success.
    

---

## **📏 Measures of Effectiveness (MoE)**

  

**What they tracked then:**

- **Quantitative:** Number of HVTs killed (e.g., ~65 senior leaders), total militants killed (1,853–3,032), number and frequency of strikes, geographic contraction of safe havens (measured by strike maps).
    
- **Operational:** Disruption of attacks plotted from FATA, attack rates against ISAF, territorial control trends in Afghanistan.
    
- **Legal/political:** Compliance narratives (briefings, collateral damage statements), success in avoiding large, public scandals, and maintaining Pakistani cooperation.
    

  

**Better MoE today (with rationale):**

- **Network resilience:** Time for groups to regenerate leadership, depth of mid‑level cadre, and coherence of operational cells (social‑network analysis rather than kill counts).
    
- **Threat output:** Rate and severity of successful/foiled plots against U.S. and allies originating from specific sanctuaries—ties tactical strikes to meaningful security outcomes.
    
- **Local governance & legitimacy:** Attitudinal measures in FATA/Afghanistan about local support for militants vs. state; whether strikes enable or undermine state authority.
    
- **Strategic diffusion:** Changes in global jihadist territorial control and attack rates (per RAND/State data), correlated with drone activity and other interventions.
    
- **Alliance cohesion:** Pakistani cooperation, NATO perceptions, and UN/ally reactions to targeted killing norms.
    

  

**Evidence summary:**

Fuller’s evidence suggests that on the narrow MoE used by U.S. officials—HVTs removed, safe havens constrained, ISAF casualties moderated—the drone campaign performed well.  However, when measured against broader strategic outcomes—ending the “War on Terror,” reducing global jihadist violence, stabilizing key regions—the results are inconclusive or negative, with jihadist violence expanding in theaters beyond AfPak.

## **🤷‍♂️ Actors & Perspectives**

  

### **Ronald Reagan & Counterterrorism Hardliners (Shultz, Casey, North)**

- **Role / position:** U.S. president and key advisors advocating a proactive, militarized CT strategy in the 1980s.
    
- **Key perspectives / assumptions:** Terrorism is an existential national‑security threat; failure to respond decisively invites further attacks; U.S. must be willing to preempt and retaliate globally.
    
- **Evolution of stance:** Move from rhetorical toughness to NSDD 138’s preemptive framework; implementation falters due to interagency resistance and scandals (Iran‑Contra).
    
- **Influence on outcomes:** Establish foundational legal and rhetorical justification for preemptive lethal CT—logic later used for drones and targeted killing.
    

  

### **Caspar Weinberger & Joint Chiefs**

- **Role / position:** Secretary of Defense and uniformed leadership opposing expansive CT missions for DoD.
    
- **Key perspectives / assumptions:** CT is primarily an intelligence/law‑enforcement problem; U.S. military should avoid small, risky operations with unclear exit strategies; use of force must meet strict tests (Weinberger Doctrine).
    
- **Evolution of stance:** Remain skeptical of CT operations throughout Reagan era; post‑9/11, some resistance erodes but concerns about “mission creep” persist.
    
- **Influence on outcomes:** Push CT into CIA’s lane; limit early use of airpower and special operations for CT, indirectly making CIA drones more attractive later.
    

  

### **Duane “Dewey” Clarridge & CTC**

- **Role / position:** Early head of CTC, champion of proactive, covert CT operations and early UAV concepts (Eagle Program).
    
- **Key perspectives / assumptions:** Terrorists must be hunted aggressively with flexible tools; covert action should be agile and unconstrained by excessive legalism.
    
- **Evolution of stance:** Iran‑Contra discredits his methods, but his vision of unmanned “Radio Shack” solutions foreshadows later drones.
    
- **Influence on outcomes:** Institutionalizes CTC; seeds the idea that unmanned systems could provide a “see it/shoot it” capability, influencing later CIA–Big Safari collaboration.
    

  

### **Bill Clinton & Advisors (Reno, Berger, Clarke)**

- **Role / position:** President and senior officials steering CT in the 1990s.
    
- **Key perspectives / assumptions:** Terrorism is a serious threat but must be tackled within legal and political constraints; prefer capture over kill; wary of civilian casualties and legal fallout.
    
- **Evolution of stance:** Move from limited responses to more aggressive but legally rationalized measures (cruise missiles, CT findings targeting bin Laden).
    
- **Influence on outcomes:** Build the legal scaffolding for targeted killing and self‑defense arguments later invoked for drones.
    

  

### **George W. Bush, Dick Cheney & Post‑9/11 NSC**

- **Role / position:** President, vice president, and senior leadership after 9/11.
    
- **Key perspectives / assumptions:** 9/11 proves the need for immediate, global, offensive CT, unconstrained by pre‑existing rules; “take the gloves off” mentality.
    
- **Evolution of stance:** Initially rely on large ground interventions and expansive detention/interrogation; later integrate CIA drones as key CT instrument.
    
- **Influence on outcomes:** Authorize armed Predators and broad findings that normalize lethal force by CIA; create political and normative backlash that later shapes Obama’s CT choices.
    

  

### **Barack Obama & John Brennan**

- **Role / position:** President and chief CT advisor overseeing the drone surge.
    
- **Key perspectives / assumptions:** Drones offer a precise, low‑risk tool compatible with winding down large wars and closing Guantánamo; must be legally justified and seen as discriminating.
    
- **Evolution of stance:** From embracing drones as “the only game in town” for AfPak, to gradual attempts at greater transparency and shifting CT burden back toward DoD.
    
- **Influence on outcomes:** Institutionalize high‑tempo drone campaign with formalized targeting processes (kill lists, PPG); shape norms for other leaders and allies.
    

  

### **CIA CTC & Directorate of Intelligence**

- **Role / position:** Core operators and analysts running the drone campaign and producing strategic assessments.
    
- **Key perspectives / assumptions:** Decapitation, safe‑haven denial, and force protection can collectively reduce terrorist threats; drones are highly effective tools when integrated with broader counterinsurgency.
    
- **Evolution of stance:** Initially CT analysts within broader CIA; over time, paramilitary mission grows, raising concerns that CIA is over‑militarized at expense of global analysis.
    
- **Influence on outcomes:** Drive adoption and refinement of drones; produce key documents (e.g., 2009 HVT “best practices” report) that justify targeting as central COIN tool.
    

  

### **Pakistani Government & ISI**

- **Role / position:** Host‑nation government and intelligence service whose cooperation is necessary for basing, overflight, and on‑the‑ground intelligence.
    
- **Key perspectives / assumptions:** Seek strategic depth vs. India and influence in Afghanistan; balance domestic anti‑drone sentiment with need for U.S. support and pressure on certain militants.
    
- **Evolution of stance:** Oscillate between tacit cooperation and public denunciation; use drone controversy to deflect blame for domestic security failures.
    
- **Influence on outcomes:** Shape where, when, and whom CIA can target; complicate U.S. messaging and legitimacy.
    

  

### **Al‑Qaeda Leadership (bin Laden, Zawahiri, al‑Yazid)**

- **Role / position:** Adversary leadership whose actions and adaptations define CT challenge.
    
- **Key perspectives / assumptions:** Need safe haven, vanguard, and symbolic attacks on U.S.; view drones as both lethal threat and propaganda tool.
    
- **Evolution of stance:** From centralized, camp‑based organization in Afghanistan to dispersed, franchised movement after 2001; later overshadowed by IS.
    
- **Influence on outcomes:** Their survivability and adaptation test limits of decapitation; their communications acknowledge drone effectiveness, indirectly validating CIA assessments.

## **🕰 Timeline of Major Events**

- **1984‑04‑03 — NSDD 138 signed** — Reagan formally designates terrorism a national‑security threat and authorizes preemptive use of lethal force worldwide, creating the policy template later used for drones.  **(inflection point: legal foundation)**
    
- **1985‑03 — Fadlallah car‑bomb attempt** — Proxy operation in Beirut kills ~80 civilians but misses the target, underscoring the risks of outsourced lethal CT and shaping future distrust of proxies.
    
- **1985‑10 — Achille Lauro hijacking** — U.S. interception of hijackers’ plane leads to a legal clash with Italy over custody, highlighting alliance and jurisdictional limits on CT operations. 
    
- **Mid‑1980s — Creation of CIA Counterterrorism Center (CTC)** — Clarridge establishes CTC, initiating dedicated bureaucratic structures for CT and exploring the Eagle Program concept for UAV‑style targeting.
    
- **1998‑08 — Cruise missile strikes on Afghanistan and Sudan (“Operation Infinite Reach”)** — Clinton uses cruise missiles against al‑Qaeda, exposing limitations (warning, collateral, target mobility) that later enhance drones’ appeal.
    
- **2000 — Predator surveillance of bin Laden in Afghanistan** — UAV feeds capture likely footage of bin Laden, but unarmed status and legal caution prevent a strike, becoming a key “missed opportunity” narrative.
    
- **2001‑02 — First armed Predator tests** — MQ‑1 successfully fires Hellfires, proving technical feasibility; legal and organizational hesitations still delay combat use.
    
- **2001‑09‑17 — Broad covert action finding** — Post‑9/11, Bush authorizes CIA to conduct lethal operations against al‑Qaeda globally, unlocking the armed Predator as an operational tool.  **(inflection point: CIA lethal authority)**
    
- **2009‑03–11 — Obama’s Afghanistan surge & drone intensification** — Obama doubles down in AfPak, using drones as a cornerstone of CT and COIN strategy while promising eventual troop withdrawal.  **(inflection point: drone surge)**
    
- **2010‑05‑21 — Boyya strike killing Mustafa Abu al‑Yazid** — High‑value kill with significant civilian casualties becomes emblematic of the promise and controversy of CIA drones.
    
- **2012‑09 — Stanford/NYU “Living Under Drones” report** — Influential civil‑society report challenges U.S. claims about low civilian casualties and minimal blowback, intensifying legal and normative debates about drones.

## **📖 Historiographical Context**

  

Fuller intervenes in a literature dominated by legal arguments, normative critiques, and journalistic exposés rather than deep historical analysis. He engages critics like Philip Alston, Mary Ellen O’Connell, Hina Shamsi, and the Stanford/NYU “Living Under Drones” report, who question legality, transparency, and civilian protection in the drone campaign.  He also dialogues with scholars skeptical of decapitation strategies (Robert Pape, Jenna Jordan, Mia Bloom) and those more supportive (Bryan Price, Patrick Johnston), situating drones within broader debates about how terrorist groups end.  Fuller builds on historical works on CIA covert action (Woodward, Persico, Weiner) and on Reagan‑era CT (Naftali, Riedel), but diverges by explicitly linking these histories to the drone program rather than treating drones as primarily a Bush–Obama phenomenon. His “covert action pendulum” concept synthesizes insights from the Church Committee era, Iran‑Contra, and post‑9/11 controversies into a single interpretive frame. Against accounts that depict drones as a qualitatively new paradigm (e.g., Andrew Cockburn, some just‑war critics), Fuller stresses continuity and incremental evolution.

## **🧩 Frameworks & Methods**

- **Levels of Analysis:**
    
    - _Strategic:_ U.S. grand strategy toward terrorism (war vs. law enforcement; preemption vs. deterrence).
        
    - _Operational:_ CTC’s campaign design—decapitation, safe‑haven denial, force protection.
        
    - _Tactical:_ Individual strikes, targeting processes, and crew behavior (e.g., Boyya).
        
    
- **Core Frameworks:**
    
    - **Covert Action Pendulum:** Cycles of overuse and backlash in CIA paramilitary activity (Church, Iran‑Contra, post‑9/11) condition later risk tolerance and legal architecture.
        
    - **See It/Shoot It Option:** Richard Clarke’s phrase, adopted by Fuller as central metaphor—drones embody the long‑sought capability to identify and immediately strike terrorists anywhere. 
        
    - **Decapitation & Safe‑Haven Denial:** CTC frames drones around leadership targeting and territorial denial, drawing on emerging COIN and terrorism studies.
        
    
- **Methods & Sources:**
    
    - Declassified documents (EOs, NSDD/PDDs, MONs), congressional testimony, and leaked CIA assessments.
        
    - NGO and journalistic datasets (BIJ, NAF) for strike counts and casualty estimates.
        
    - Legal scholarship and UN reports for normative debates.
        
    - Terrorism and COIN literature for evaluating decapitation and safe‑haven logic.
        
    
- **Instruments of Power (Air/Space/UAS):**
    
    - Drones function as an ISR/strike hybrid platform, integrating strategic attack (leadership), interdiction (lines of communication), and close support/force protection roles.
        
    - Space assets (GPS, SATCOM) and global basing are essential enablers, highlighting that UAS effectiveness is inseparable from broader aerospace infrastructure.

## **🔄 Learning Over Time (within the book & vs. prior SAASS 628 cases)**

  

**What shifted?**

- From **proxies and symbolic raids** (Fadlallah, Achille Lauro, Libya bombing) to **persistent ISR and precision strike** via UAVs.
    
- From **legal prohibition** (assassination bans) to **legalized targeted killing** under self‑defense frameworks.
    
- From **capture/detain** focus (renditions, black sites) to **kill‑focused** CT as detention became politically unsustainable.
    
- From **ad‑hoc CT operations** to a routinized global drone campaign with formalized decision processes.
    

  

**What persisted?**

- Desire for **risk transfer**—minimizing U.S. casualties and political costs by pushing danger onto proxies, standoff weapons, and eventually machines.
    
- Reliance on **elite decision‑making** with limited congressional oversight whenever paramilitary CIA tools are involved.
    
- Difficulty translating tactical and operational successes into lasting strategic outcomes in complex political environments.
    

  

**What was (mis)learned?**

- **Learned:** High‑value targeting works best when integrated into broader strategies; drones are potent at denying specific safe havens.
    
- **Mislearned:** That decapitating al‑Qaeda core would be sufficient to end the jihadist threat; the movement adapted and diffused geographically.
    

  

**Comparative to prior SAASS 628 cases:**

- Relative to classic strategic bombing campaigns (e.g., WWII, Kosovo), drones exemplify _precision denial_ more than punishment or coercion: success is measured by disruptions and degraded networks rather than surrendered governments.
    
- Compared to Pape’s denial vs. punishment framework, drones mostly conduct **denial of safe haven** and **attrition of capabilities**, not strategic coercion of a state—highlighting the challenge of applying airpower theory to nonstate adversaries.
    

---

## **🧐 Critical Reflections**

- **Strengths:**
    
    - Integrates legal, technological, and institutional histories, showing how CT airpower emerges from long‑term trends rather than sudden revolutions.
        
    - Offers a nuanced assessment of effectiveness—acknowledging significant operational successes while highlighting strategic limits and diffusion of jihadist violence.
        
    - Uses “covert action pendulum” and “see it/shoot it” as compelling frameworks that travel well to other CT cases.
        
    
- **Weaknesses / Blind Spots:**
    
    - Heavy dependence on U.S. and Western sources; Pakistani and Afghan perspectives, while present, are filtered through secondary reporting.
        
    - Focus on AfPak core somewhat underplays the drone program’s interaction with Yemen, Somalia, and other theaters.
        
    - The assessment of blowback is cautious but perhaps leans toward U.S. official and quantitative metrics; deeper qualitative work on radicalization pathways might reach more pessimistic conclusions.
        
    
- **Unresolved Questions:**
    
    - To what degree did CIA’s focus on drones materially impede its ability to foresee and interpret the Arab Spring and IS rise?
        
    - How sustainable is a CT model that relies heavily on covert lethal force in terms of international norms and long‑term alliances?

## **⚔️ Comparative Insights (link to prior course readings)**

- **Vs. classic strategic bombing (e.g., Douhet, Warden, Pape):** Drones invert much of the theory—rather than massed bomber fleets risking aircrew in decisive campaigns, we see continuous, low‑signature attrition of individuals. Yet, like Pape’s denial strategy, Fuller’s account suggests airpower is most effective when it denies key physical and organizational “bases” to the enemy (safe haven, leadership sanctuaries).
    
- **Vs. Desert Storm/Kosovo cases:** Whereas those campaigns targeted state centers of gravity to compel policy change, the CIA’s drone war targets nonstate actors whose political center of gravity lies in ideology and social networks—harder for airpower alone to break.
    
- **Vs. CT literature on decapitation (Jordan, Cronin, Price):** Fuller aligns with more optimistic quantitative findings (Price/Johnston) regarding decapitation’s contribution to reduced violence but cautions that success is partial and contingent on broader political context.

## **❓ Open Questions (for seminar)**

1. **What lessons informed the adoption of unmanned aircraft as a tool of counterterrorism policy?**
    
    - Lessons from **proxy failures** (Fadlallah) taught that outsourced lethal CT was imprecise, deniable but politically costly, and hard to control.
        
    - **Alliance/jurisdiction conflicts** (Achille Lauro) showed that snatch operations in cooperative environments invite diplomatic crises. 
        
    - **Cruise missile limitations** (flight time, warning, collateral) revealed that standoff fires were too blunt for mobile, networked terrorists.
        
    - Early **UAV ISR successes** (Lofty View, Predator over Afghanistan) demonstrated the value of persistent surveillance for CT, creating demand for an armed “see it/shoot it” option.
        
    - Political blowback from **renditions and detention** pushed future administrations toward tools that neutralized threats without expanding Guantánamo or black sites—drones filled this niche.
        
    
2. **Which actors were most important in this adoption and why?**
    
    - **Reagan‑era hardliners (Shultz, Casey, North)** established the conceptual and legal foundation (NSDD 138, preemptive global force) that later made drone CT thinkable.
        
    - **Clarridge & CTC** institutionalized proactive CT and early UAV ideas, building the organizational infrastructure essential for later adoption.
        
    - **Clinton administration lawyers and NSC staff (Reno, Berger, Clarke)** crafted legal interpretations of assassination bans and self‑defense, and articulated the “see it/shoot it” desire, so that when UAVs matured, a legal path already existed.
        
    - **Bush administration & CIA leadership (Tenet, Black, Hayden)** authorized and operationalized armed Predators under post‑9/11 findings.
        
    - **Obama & Brennan** elevated drones to the centerpiece of CT strategy, refined targeting rules, and normalized their use in U.S. policy.
        
    
3. **What limits existed on airpower in a counterterrorism role?**
    
    - **Legal/Normative:** Assassination bans, sovereignty rules, and IHL obligations forced drones into a self‑defense framework and demanded (at least nominal) minimization of civilian casualties.
        
    - **Political:** Host‑nation politics (Pakistan), alliance dynamics, and domestic casualty sensitivity constrained basing, target selection, and transparency.
        
    - **Operational/Technological:** Dependence on basing, SATCOM, and vulnerable ISR networks limited where drones could fly and how persistently.
        
    - **Intelligence:** Reliance on local informants and pattern‑of‑life analysis introduced uncertainty and potential for mis‑targeting.
        
    - **Strategic:** Airpower could disrupt and deny but not create legitimate governance or address ideological drivers of jihadism.
        
    
4. **How effective was American airpower in accomplishing counterterrorism objectives?**
    
    - On **narrow operational objectives** (destroy al‑Qaeda core, deny AfPak safe haven, protect ISAF), Fuller concludes the CIA drone campaign was largely successful: leadership attrition, restricted movement, and support to NATO operations are well‑documented.
        
    - On **broader strategic goals** (ending the War on Terror, reducing global jihadist violence), effectiveness is limited: jihadism diffuses to new arenas (Syria, Iraq, North Africa) and extremist territorial control actually increases in the decade after drone warfare ramps up.
        
    - Fuller’s bottom line: drones are effective CT tools at tactical and operational levels but insufficient to produce decisive strategic outcomes on their own.
        
    
5. **What does Fuller’s account tell us about the strengths and challenges of writing contemporary history?**
    
    - **Strengths:** Access to newly declassified documents, NGO databases, and real‑time legal and policy debates allows Fuller to link archival material with current controversies in a way older histories cannot.
        
    - **Challenges:** Ongoing classification, incomplete data on casualties and targeting criteria, and evolving legal interpretations mean the story is necessarily partial; key documents and perspectives (especially non‑U.S.) remain obscured.
        
    - Fuller must triangulate between government statements, leaks, and investigative journalism, which can conflict, forcing cautious inferences.
        
    - As policies and drone technology continue to evolve, any snapshot risks becoming outdated, underscoring his theme that “true watersheds are seldom spotted” in real time.

## **🗂 Notable Quotes & Thoughts**

- “Ultimately, what this book demonstrates is that the CIA’s drone campaign in the AfPak region marks a return to, rather than a further departure from, counterterrorism methods and strategy developed in the decades preceding 9/11.” (p. 21) — Core thesis: continuity over rupture. 
    
- “The legal architecture that authorized the hundreds of drone strikes that the Obama administration launched… [is] the product of two decades of persistent experimentation and evolution in America’s ongoing effort to neutralize the threat posed by burgeoning anti‑American terrorist groups.” (p. 63) — Highlights incremental, path‑dependent learning. 
    
- “The leadership’s deterioration has equally been the result of the drone’s original, but frequently overlooked, defining characteristic—its endurance.” (p. 224) — Reframes drones: persistence, not just precision, is central to their effect. 
    
- “If the people of the war‑affected areas are satisfied with any counter militancy strategy, it is the Drone attacks which they support the most.” (Peshawar Declaration, quoted p. 239) — Challenges simple blowback narratives; local attitudes are complex. 
    
- “If one is to measure success purely by examining the degree to which the campaign achieved the primary goals that were set out in Obama’s orders, it would appear that the CTC’s drone war was a success… The real measure of success, however—whether or not this has been enough to move the United States closer toward an end to the War on Terror—remains unclear, but it looks unlikely.” (pp. 239–240) — The tactical/strategic gap in one paragraph. 
    
- “For decades the United States sought a weapon that would allow it to strike at targets in places it could not otherwise reach. In drones it has this weapon…” (p. 251) — Summarizes the long‑term technological quest that drones fulfill.

## **🧾 Final‑Paper Hooks**

- **Claim 1:** The CIA’s drone campaign is best understood as the institutionalization of Reagan‑era CT logic under new technological and legal conditions, not as a fundamentally new policy innovation.
    
    - _Evidence/quotes/pages:_ NSDD 138 (Reagan), the “covert action pendulum” analysis (pp. ~130–135), and Fuller’s explicit “return rather than departure” thesis (p. 21).
        
    - _Counterarguments:_ Emphasize proliferation of Title 50 lethal operations and globalized kill lists as genuinely novel; respond that underlying logic (preemptive, global CT) is old even if tools evolved.
        
    
- **Claim 2:** Drones are highly effective at achieving narrow CT objectives (decapitation, safe‑haven denial, force protection) but structurally unable to deliver decisive strategic outcomes against a diffuse jihadist movement.
    
    - _Evidence:_ Quantitative leadership and militant kill estimates (p. 231), safe‑haven denial discussion (pp. 224–225), and mismatch with global jihadist growth (pp. 240–241).
        
    - _Counterarguments:_ Some may claim that without drones, global jihadist violence would be worse; you can respond by emphasizing Fuller’s “partial success, global diffusion” framing.
        
    
- **Claim 3:** The choice of drones under Obama reflects not only their tactical utility but also political and normative constraints arising from earlier CT practices (renditions, torture, large wars).
    
    - _Evidence:_ Chapter 5’s account of renditions and black sites becoming “politically poisonous” (pp. 178–191), Obama’s rhetoric on Iraq and Afghanistan (pp. 231–232), and the need for a CT tool that creates no new detainees.
        
    - _Counterarguments:_ Critics may see drones as evidence of moral backsliding; your argument can emphasize trade‑offs: drones as “least bad” option given political constraints, but still normatively fraught.
        
    
- **Claim 4:** The diffusion of drone technology and doctrine poses new challenges to U.S. airpower dominance, as rivals and nonstate actors adopt their own “see it/shoot it” options.
    
    - _Evidence:_ Conclusion’s discussion of global UAV proliferation and hybrid warfare (pp. 251–252). 
        
    - _Counterarguments:_ Some may argue U.S. still retains qualitative edge; you can stress Fuller’s cautionary historical analogy (machine guns, tanks, nukes) and the inevitability of diffusion.
