# NATO's Gamble

## Online Description

The author reveals that from the outset, the military leaders set to execute the campaign had no clear strategic guidance on what the operation was to achieve, and he further argues that the airpower community's general focus on high-intensity wars hampered them from developing strategies to fit the political complexities of the Kosovo crisis."--BOOK JACKET.
  

## **🔫 Author Background**

- Dag Henriksen is a Norwegian airpower scholar and officer, long associated with the Royal Norwegian Air Force Academy, where he has taught airpower theory, strategy, and military history.
    
- He completed a PhD at the Scottish Centre for War Studies, University of Glasgow; this book is adapted from his dissertation “Operation Allied Force: A Product of Military Theory or Political Pragmatism?” (2006) (p. xii).
    
- His research focuses on the theory and practice of airpower, coercive diplomacy, and NATO operations, particularly in the Balkans.
    
- Henriksen has written widely on modern air campaigns and the conceptual foundations of airpower, often emphasizing political context and the limits of high‑tech force in complex conflicts.

## **🔍 Author’s Main Issue / Thesis**

- Henriksen argues that NATO entered Operation Allied Force (OAF) politically and militarily unprepared for the kind of humanitarian war it chose to fight, having planned only a short, symbolic bombing campaign and no real war strategy or end‑state (p. 11).
    
- Airpower became the centerpiece of “coercive diplomacy,” but both political leaders and professional airmen misunderstood how to integrate it into a coherent coercive strategy under tight normative and alliance constraints (pp. 11–13).
    
- The international handling of the Kosovo crisis was shaped less by events in Kosovo itself and more by prior experiences—especially Bosnia and Desert Storm—and by divergent U.S.–European perspectives on power, diplomacy, and the use of force (pp. xii–xiii, 176–177).
    
- NATO’s “gamble” was to believe that a few days of limited air strikes would coerce Milosevic, largely replicating the perceived Bosnia template; Milosevic called this bluff, forcing NATO to improvise its way to eventual success over 78 days (pp. xi–xiii).
    
- The book contends that both advocates and critics of airpower have oversimplified Kosovo; airpower was indispensable but not used in a way consistent with existing theory, and NATO “prevailed despite itself,” not because of a well‑designed air campaign.

## **🧭 One‑Paragraph Overview**

  

Henriksen tells the story of how NATO stumbled into its first war—an air‑only, humanitarian intervention against a sovereign state—without clear political aims, an agreed end‑state, or a coherent strategy for applying airpower. He reconstructs the intellectual background (airpower debates, Pape vs. Warden, coercive diplomacy theory), the U.S. and NATO political learning from Vietnam, Desert Storm, and Bosnia, and then walks through the Kosovo crisis from 1998 to the end of OAF. He shows how U.S. leaders, haunted by Bosnia and constrained by domestic casualty aversion, elevated airpower as a low‑risk coercive tool and pushed NATO into issuing threats it was not prepared to execute. Milosevic, for his part, learned from Bosnia and early NATO missteps that Western threats could be bluffed against, while he exploited alliance caution and humanitarian concerns. In the end, airpower, internal Serbian political pressures, Russian diplomacy, and the shadow—however faint—of a ground option combined to coerce Belgrade, but in a fashion far more contingent and messy than clean “airpower victory” narratives suggest.

## **🎯 Course Themes Tracker**

- **Limits on airpower:** Alliance politics, legal/normative constraints, poor strategy design, intelligence gaps, adversary adaptation, and domestic casualty aversion heavily shaped what airpower could do.
    
- **Expectations vs. reality:** U.S. and NATO elites expected a short, low‑risk “Bosnia replay” of 2–4 days of bombing; instead they got a 78‑day campaign with major political strain.
    
- **Adaptation & learning:** Both NATO and Milosevic improvised; NATO slowly expanded target sets and messaging, while Belgrade shifted to dispersion, camouflage, and accelerated ethnic cleansing.
    
- **Efficacy (tac → op → strat → political):** Tactical air success did not neatly translate into operational or political leverage; coercive effects depended on Serbian domestic politics and diplomacy as much as bomb damage.
    
- **Alliance/coalition dynamics:** Nineteen NATO members, divergent U.S.–European perspectives, and the absence of a UNSC mandate drove gradualism and target micromanagement.
    
- **Domain interplay:** Airpower operated without ground maneuver, but intimately tied to ISR, space‑enabled C2, information operations, and diplomatic signaling.
    

---

## **🔑 Top Takeaways**

- NATO went to war without a clear political strategy, agreed war aims, or end‑state; OAF began as an under‑planned “signal” rather than a war plan (pp. 11–12, 205–206).
    
- Airpower was chosen because it seemed to offer low‑risk, politically controllable coercion, extrapolated from Desert Storm and Deliberate Force, but policymakers and airmen misapplied airpower theory in a constrained humanitarian context (pp. 12–13, 57–59).
    
- U.S. lessons from Bosnia—“airpower plus NATO leadership works”—combined with moral guilt over prior inaction to drive an early, ambitious reliance on NATO and airpower for Kosovo (pp. 107–109, 140).
    
- Milosevic’s own lessons from Bosnia and early Kosovo threats led him to discount NATO rhetoric, treat air threats as bluff, and use violence and refugee flows to manipulate Western politics (pp. 140–141, 169–170, 176–177).
    
- Airpower’s effectiveness in OAF was real but contingent: it imposed costs, undermined Belgrade’s strategy, and signaled resolve, but its coercive leverage matured only as strikes intensified, diplomacy shifted, and Milosevic’s internal political base eroded.
    
- Politically imposed limits—no ground invasion, strict ROE, target vetoes, fear of casualties—forced NATO into a gradual, politically driven air campaign that airmen themselves believed was suboptimal (pp. 57–58, 81).
    
- The campaign demonstrates both the possibilities and limits of airpower as a stand‑alone coercive instrument in limited wars, highlighting that strategic success can emerge from flawed strategy when the adversary is internally brittle.
    
- For SAASS 628, Henriksen offers a corrective to triumphalist “airpower alone” accounts and a rich process‑tracing of how ideas, alliances, and prior wars shape the employment and limits of airpower.

## **📒 Sections**

  

### **Introduction**

  

**Summary:**

Henriksen opens with the claim that OAF was NATO’s first war against a sovereign state and its first major, air‑only humanitarian intervention, conceptually unlike prior conflicts (p. 11). NATO entered this war without a plan for what Kosovo should look like afterward and with only a loosely focused bombing campaign expected to last a few days (p. 11). U.S. leaders such as Albright, Gelbard, and Clark rapidly decided that Milosevic was the core problem and that coercive diplomacy backed by airpower was the right tool, drawing heavily on Desert Storm and Deliberate Force as reference points (pp. 11–12). Airpower seemed to offer precise, low‑risk, reversible political signaling under alliance and legal constraints, and key actors assumed that a few days of bombing would compel Belgrade (pp. 12–13). Henriksen frames this as a “gamble”: NATO relied on a show‑of‑force concept that Milosevic promptly called, forcing the alliance into a prolonged 78‑day campaign (pp. xi–xiii). The book’s purpose is to explain why NATO was so unprepared, why airpower became central to its crisis management, and how transatlantic differences over power and the use of force shaped the course of events (pp. xi–xii).

  

**Key Points:**

- OAF was a war of humanitarian intent but waged with an air‑only strategy, challenging traditional non‑intervention norms (p. 11).
    
- NATO went to war without clear political guidance, a defined end‑state for Kosovo, or a serious postwar plan (pp. 11, 205–206).
    
- Airpower was quickly elevated to the central instrument of coercive diplomacy, based on perceived successes in 1991 and 1995 (pp. 12–13).
    
- Key leaders believed a short bombing campaign would suffice—what Henriksen, citing Lord Owen, calls a bluff that Milosevic called (pp. xi–xiii).
    
- The book focuses on U.S. political/military structures and transatlantic differences in conceptions of power and force (pp. xii–xiii, 14).
    
- NATO’s unpreparedness, especially regarding the use of force in coercive diplomacy, is both widely acknowledged and, in Henriksen’s view, under‑analyzed in terms of airpower’s role (pp. xi–xiii).
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- Early, unrealistic expectations about airpower’s coercive potential vs. the reality of protracted coercion.
    
- Political limits and alliance dynamics as the primary shapers of air employment.
    
- Learning and mis‑learning from earlier cases (Desert Storm, Bosnia), feeding into Kosovo.
    
- Airpower as an attractive but conceptually misunderstood tool for limited war and humanitarian intervention.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Political:** Nineteen‑member NATO, no UNSC authorization, fear of casualties; exogenous and partly adjustable (through consensus building and messaging).
    
- **Strategic:** No defined end‑state or theory of victory beyond “stop the killing”; endogenous but initially unaddressed.
    
- **Legal/Normative:** Need to justify intervention as humanitarian; constrained target selection and escalation.
    
- **Operational:** No ground option, limited pre‑war planning, alliance vetoes on targets.
    
- **Intelligence/Information:** Misreading Milosevic’s resolve and pain tolerance; overreliance on Bosnia analogy.

### **Chapter 1: The First Week of OAF**

  

**Summary:**

Henriksen narrates how OAF began as an under‑resourced, politically constrained air effort with a narrow target set and minimal strategic guidance. NATO launched with a limited Phase I campaign against FRY air defenses and selected military infrastructure, while many European leaders still expected the bombing to be over within days. Within CAOC Vicenza and JTF Noble Anvil, planners had no clear political end‑state or explicit coercive strategy; one targeting cell reportedly sought “guidance” from NATO’s public spokesman on CNN and reverse‑engineered objectives from televised talking points (p. 19). The alliance’s decision to rule out ground forces upfront further narrowed military options and signaled limited escalation potential to Milosevic. Early strikes had little observable effect on Belgrade’s core interests or on operations in Kosovo, while ethnic cleansing on the ground accelerated. The first week thus displayed a sharp mismatch between airpower’s operational tasks and the strategic and political ends NATO had (vaguely) in mind, setting up the later iterations of the campaign.

  

**Key Points:**

- OAF opened with a narrow, heavily politicized target list and minimal anticipation of a prolonged air war.
    
- NATO leaders assumed that a limited show of force would suffice; Milosevic instead intensified actions in Kosovo.
    
- Targeteers lacked clear guidance on desired political and military effects and sometimes inferred aims from public statements (p. 19).
    
- Alliance rules, national caveats, and concerns over collateral damage slowed target approval.
    
- With ground forces publicly excluded, airpower bore the entire burden of coercion from the outset.
    
- The first week revealed that NATO had prepared for a symbolic demonstration, not a sustained coercive campaign.
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Expectations vs. reality:** Early optimism about short air campaigns colliding with Serbian resilience.
    
- **Alliance dynamics:** Consensus on “doing something,” but not on what success meant or how to employ force.
    
- **Efficacy chain:** Tactical success against fixed targets did little to stop ethnic cleansing or generate immediate strategic leverage.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Political:** Strong pressure to limit casualties and collateral damage, plus national vetoes on sensitive targets.
    
- **Strategic:** Absence of an articulated theory of how initial strikes would produce political concessions.
    
- **Operational:** Phased, incremental approach; limited pre‑strike shaping of air defenses; no integrated ground threat.
    
- **Adversary Adaptation:** FRY ground forces dispersed and blended with the civilian environment, limiting visible impact of air attacks.

### **Chapter 2: The Airpower Debate and OAF**

  

**Summary:**

Henriksen surveys core airpower theory and the late‑20th‑century debate that framed expectations leading into Kosovo. He reviews classical advocates like Douhet and interwar “industrial web” ideas, then contrasts them with post–Cold War theorists such as John Warden and Robert Pape. Warden’s “five rings” and Desert Storm experience, which seemed to validate strategic air attack, left many airmen believing in decisive, leadership‑focused campaigns; yet OAF’s politically constrained environment made such an approach untenable. By contrast, Pape’s Bombing to Win, with its taxonomy of punishment, risk, denial, and decapitation strategies, argued that coercive airpower is most effective when supporting ground operations and that punishment rarely works (pp. 57–59, 82–84). Henriksen notes that USAF doctrine over‑emphasized decisive, high‑intensity major theater war and neglected coercive applications in limited conflicts, leaving air leaders doctrinally unprepared for Kosovo’s humanitarian context (p. 57). This chapter sets the intellectual baseline: OAF became a real‑world test of coercive airpower theory under conditions that neither classic nor contemporary airpower doctrines fit comfortably.

  

**Key Points:**

- Classic airpower thought privileged rapid, punishing strategic bombing, often targeting civilians or industrial capacity.
    
- Warden’s theory, influential within the USAF, emphasized decapitation and systemic paralysis, sidelining fielded forces.
    
- Pape’s empirical work argued that denial strategies integrated with ground operations have the best coercive prospects, and that punishment and risk rarely coerce modern states (pp. 82–84).
    
- OAF, as an air‑only, humanitarian campaign, aligned poorly with both Warden’s decapitation and Pape’s denial in support of ground forces.
    
- Airmen like Lt Gen Michael Short later complained that they were prevented from executing the “classic air campaign” they had been taught at Maxwell, constrained by political choices (p. 57).
    
- The USAF’s doctrinal focus on decisiveness in major theater war left a “doctrinal void” on coercive airpower for nontraditional conflicts like Kosovo (p. 57).
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Limits on airpower:** Theories built around total war or classic interstate conflict proved ill‑suited for humanitarian coercion.
    
- **Expectations vs. reality:** Desert Storm‑based expectations of quick strategic paralysis collided with incremental, politically driven targeting.
    
- **Learning:** Kosovo forced re‑thinking of doctrinal assumptions about decisive vs. coercive airpower.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Strategic:** Doctrinal predisposition toward decisive, high‑intensity conflict; ill‑matched to limited political aims.
    
- **Political/Legal:** Punishment strategies (e.g., large‑scale attacks on civilian infrastructure) were normatively and politically constrained.
    
- **Technological:** Precision strike enabled selective targeting but could not compensate for a lack of clear coercive logic.
    
- **Information:** Misapplication of airpower theories due to partial reading of historical evidence (e.g., Desert Storm, Deliberate Force).

### **Chapter 3: From Vietnam to Kosovo – U.S. Foreign Policy and the Use of Force**

  

**Summary:**

Henriksen traces U.S. use‑of‑force evolution from Vietnam through the end of the Cold War to establish why airpower appeared particularly attractive in the 1990s. The Vietnam experience and subsequent Weinberger/Powell doctrine stressed clear objectives, overwhelming force, and public support, fostering an aversion to open‑ended, casualty‑heavy ground wars. Desert Storm seemed to vindicate a model of high‑tech, air‑led warfare achieving rapid, low‑cost success, while Somalia and Haiti reinforced sensitivity to casualties and political costs. The Clinton administration gravitated toward “limited liability” interventions where airpower, sanctions, and diplomacy could be combined to manage crises without large ground deployments. In this context, OAF appeared to offer a way to apply force in the Balkans while avoiding Bosnia’s prolonged ground entanglement and earlier moral failures. Yet Henriksen argues that this political preference for low‑risk force was not matched by serious thinking about coercive strategy or postwar requirements, sowing the seeds for NATO’s unpreparedness when the crisis escalated.

  

**Key Points:**

- Vietnam and the Powell doctrine instilled caution about ground wars and a preference for clear, limited objectives.
    
- Desert Storm’s apparent airpower‑centric success created a belief that high‑tech air campaigns could deliver quick strategic results with minimal casualties.
    
- Somalia and other 1990s cases amplified domestic casualty aversion and reinforced political risk sensitivity.
    
- Clinton‑era use of force favored limited interventions framed as humanitarian or peace enforcement, with airpower as the leading instrument.
    
- This political‑strategic environment predisposed U.S. leaders to seek an air‑only solution in Kosovo, without committing to invasion or large ground occupation.
    
- The emphasis on minimizing political risk trumped thorough planning for escalation and postwar stabilization.
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Expectations vs. reality:** U.S. elites expected OAF to mirror Desert Storm’s low‑casualty, high‑tech model, ignoring differences in aims and constraints.
    
- **Learning/mis‑learning:** Bosnia and Desert Storm became templates; Vietnam and Somalia were negative models to be avoided at almost any cost.
    
- **Limits on airpower:** Political risk aversion narrowed available instruments, forcing airpower to carry burdens it was not designed to bear alone.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Political (domestic):** Strong aversion to casualties and “quagmires,” effectively ruling out ground invasion at the outset.
    
- **Strategic:** Preference for limited objectives and quick exits, discouraging thorough planning for long wars or post‑conflict governance.
    
- **Resource/Time:** Desire to limit resource commitments and duration, increasing dependence on “cheap” air campaigns.

### **Chapter 4: Lessons from Bosnia**

  

**Summary:**

This chapter examines how Bosnia profoundly shaped U.S. and NATO thinking about Kosovo. After years of hesitation, the 1995 combination of NATO airpower (Deliberate Force), Croatian ground offensives, and robust U.S. diplomacy paved the way to the Dayton Accords. Many policymakers—Albright, Holbrooke, and others—came to believe that airpower plus NATO leadership could coerce Balkan actors effectively (pp. 107–109, 140). They also drew negative lessons from UNPROFOR, the “dual key” arrangement, and Russian obstruction, concluding that NATO should be in charge from the start in Kosovo and that the UN’s role should be limited (pp. 107–109, 132). Moral guilt over Bosnia’s failures and the desire not to “have another Bosnia” further motivated more forceful early action in Kosovo. However, Henriksen stresses that Bosnia’s specific conditions (ground offensives, war fatigue, different balance of power) were not replicated in Kosovo. Treating Bosnia as a model encouraged overconfidence in short air campaigns and underestimation of Milosevic’s willingness to endure punishment.

  

**Key Points:**

- Deliberate Force was widely seen as a success, reinforcing faith in airpower as a coercive tool and in NATO leadership (pp. 107–109).
    
- UNPROFOR’s constraints and the “dual key” experience led U.S. officials to insist on NATO command and avoid UN operational control (p. 132).
    
- Russian obstruction in Bosnia contributed to the decision to minimize Russian veto power in Kosovo crisis management (pp. 107–109).
    
- A sense of moral failure in Bosnia (“diplomacy without force became an unloaded weapon”) fueled determination not to repeat inaction (p. 132).
    
- By mid‑1998, U.S. leadership, NATO primacy, and airpower as the coercive instrument were already baked into the Kosovo approach (pp. 140–141).
    
- Over‑learning from Bosnia obscured key differences between the two crises, especially the absence of friendly ground offensives in Kosovo.
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Learning over time:** Bosnia served as both a positive and negative model, but lessons were selectively interpreted.
    
- **Alliance dynamics:** NATO, not the UN or Contact Group, became the central crisis manager, with the U.S. driving policy (pp. 107–109, 132).
    
- **Efficacy:** Success in Bosnia encouraged faith in short, calibrated bombing as a trigger for diplomacy—an assumption that proved risky in Kosovo.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Political:** Determination to avoid UN “dual key” constraints drove consolidation under NATO, but also sidelined broader legitimacy mechanisms.
    
- **Strategic:** Overconfidence in an air‑plus‑diplomacy template encouraged under‑planning for alternative paths when quick coercion failed.
    
- **Adversary Adaptation:** Milosevic, having survived Bosnia, learned to read Western debates and exploit their reluctance to commit ground forces (pp. 140–141).

### **Chapter 5: The Crisis Emerges – NATO Becomes Responsible for Crisis Management**

  

**Summary:**

Henriksen moves back into the Kosovo crisis narrative, describing how a long‑smoldering conflict escalated after Kosovo lost autonomy in 1989 and the Albanians initially pursued a nonviolent strategy under Ibrahim Rugova (pp. 153–154). The emergence of the KLA and the February 1998 Drenica crackdown pushed violence above the threshold that captured international attention, leading key U.S. officials to identify Milosevic as the central problem (p. 12). By spring 1998, U.S. diplomacy had maneuvered NATO into the lead crisis‑management role, partly out of frustration with the Contact Group, Russia, and the UN (pp. 132, 140–141). Gen. Klaus Naumann later called it a “big mistake” to permanently transfer crisis management to NATO, as the alliance was politically ill‑prepared to sustain credible threats (p. 153). NATO’s early air exercise Determined Falcon, intended as a show of force, instead advertised the alliance’s inability to strike quickly and convinced Milosevic that NATO’s threats were bluffs (pp. 169–170). Thus, as Kosovo moved toward war, NATO had assumed responsibility but lacked the political unity, legal basis, or military strategy to coerce effectively.

  

**Key Points:**

- Kosovo’s crisis emerged from long‑term Serb–Albanian tensions, initially managed by Rugova’s nonviolent LDK strategy (pp. 153–154).
    
- The KLA’s rise and Serb crackdowns pushed the conflict into the spotlight and onto NATO’s agenda.
    
- U.S. officials pressed to shift crisis management to NATO, sidelining the Contact Group and UN, to avoid Bosnia‑style paralysis (pp. 132, 140–141).
    
- Naumann later judged the permanent transfer to NATO as a mistake, given alliance readiness for coercive diplomacy (p. 153).
    
- Determined Falcon and similar moves revealed NATO’s inability to act swiftly, teaching Milosevic that air threats were not immediately executable (pp. 169–170).
    
- By mid‑1998, NATO had threatened more than it could quickly deliver, undermining its coercive credibility (pp. 169–170).
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Alliance dynamics:** Early U.S. diplomatic choices locked NATO into a lead role, regardless of its internal divisions and capabilities.
    
- **Limits on airpower:** Air exercises and shows of force without follow‑through eroded coercive leverage.
    
- **Adversary learning:** Milosevic learned to treat NATO threats skeptically, which shaped his willingness to resist in 1999.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Political:** NATO consensus for tough rhetoric outran consensus for strong action, creating a credibility gap.
    
- **Operational:** NATO lacked rapid‑execution plans to back air threats within 24–48 hours, violating Naumann’s realized “lesson” (pp. 169–170).
    
- **Legal:** No UNSC mandate further complicated decisions about when and how to use force.

### **Chapter 6: Shift in U.S. Policy toward the KLA – and the Summer Offensive**

  

**Summary:**

Henriksen details how U.S. policy toward the KLA shifted from branding it “terrorist” to de facto partnership, a change that significantly influenced the escalation dynamic. Initially, Washington criticized KLA violence and tried to support Rugova’s nonviolent approach; however, as Serb repression increased and diplomacy stalled, U.S. officials began to see the KLA as a necessary partner in pressuring Belgrade. The summer 1998 offensive saw heavy fighting, Serbian village clearances, and growing humanitarian concerns, which NATO used rhetorically to justify its emerging threat of force. This shift undercut previous international messages about rejecting terrorism and complicated efforts to pressure the KLA into restraint. Henriksen argues that the KLA deliberately sought to provoke Serb overreaction and international intervention, seeing Albanian suffering as a means to mobilize support (pp. 176–177). By the end of 1998, the alignment of U.S., KLA, and NATO interests in pressuring Serbia, combined with prior Bosnia lessons, helped lock in airpower‑backed coercive diplomacy as the default strategy.

  

**Key Points:**

- U.S. policy evolved from condemning the KLA as terrorist to tolerating and eventually cooperating with it.
    
- The KLA sought escalation, seeing violence and Serb reprisals as a way to draw in NATO (pp. 176–177).
    
- The summer 1998 fighting increased humanitarian urgency and political pressure for NATO action.
    
- U.S. alignment with the KLA weakened coercive leverage over Albanian behavior and undermined even‑handed diplomacy.
    
- This alignment helped frame the conflict as Milosevic vs. an abused Albanian population, simplifying an otherwise complex local political landscape.
    
- Airpower became further entrenched as the chosen coercive instrument to support what increasingly resembled a side‑taking intervention.
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Efficacy and legitimacy:** Supporting the KLA boosted tactical leverage but raised legitimacy questions and complicated postwar governance.
    
- **Adversary adaptation:** The KLA adapted to Western incentives, deliberately courting NATO by generating crises.
    
- **Limits on airpower:** Using airpower to support an insurgent partner in a complex civil conflict without ground presence created intelligence and legitimacy challenges.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Political:** U.S. alignment with the KLA constrained diplomatic flexibility and credibility as a neutral broker.
    
- **Intelligence/Information:** Reliance on KLA narratives and ground reports increased the risk of bias and manipulation.
    
- **Strategic:** Supporting an actor with maximalist aims (independence) complicated limited NATO war aims focused on autonomy and protection.

### **Chapter 7: NATO Threatens with Air Strikes – Silence before the Storm**

  

**Summary:**

Here Henriksen analyzes the period of escalating NATO threats in late 1998 before OAF. The October 1998 Holbrooke–Milosevic agreement, backed by implicit air threats, produced temporary de‑escalation and the Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM). Yet the KLA used the breathing space to regroup, and both sides violated the agreement. NATO’s repeated threats of air strikes, including activation orders and ultimatums, became increasingly routine, while internal divisions, legal concerns (Russian and UNSC opposition), and lack of consensus on objectives delayed decisive action. Gen. Naumann later noted that NATO “threatened itself into a corner”: repeated, unfulfilled threats undermined credibility and emboldened Milosevic (pp. 169–170). Air exercises like Determined Falcon highlighted the alliance’s inability to promptly follow through, and Milosevic correctly inferred that NATO lacked the unity to launch immediate strikes (pp. 169–170). Thus, when Račak and Rambouillet finally pushed NATO over the threshold into war, the alliance entered with its coercive reputation already damaged.

  

**Key Points:**

- The Holbrooke agreement temporarily reduced violence, but both the KLA and Serb forces exploited and violated it.
    
- NATO repeatedly threatened air strikes but failed to act quickly, undermining its coercive credibility.
    
- Naumann and others later recognized that threats without capability or unity to execute promptly are counterproductive (pp. 169–170).
    
- Legal and political divisions (notably over UNSC authorization and Russian opposition) slowed the move from threat to action.
    
- The KVM’s presence and limitations complicated the picture; its withdrawal later became a prelude to war.
    
- By early 1999, NATO’s reputation for bluffing affected Milosevic’s calculus about the risks of defiance.
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Coercive diplomacy gone wrong:** Threats not backed by timely action can weaken rather than strengthen deterrence.
    
- **Alliance dynamics:** Consensus on rhetoric but not on execution created a hollow coercive stance.
    
- **Limits on airpower:** Airpower as a threat only works if there is credible willingness and capacity to use it decisively.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Political:** Internal NATO divisions, Russia’s stance, and legal legitimacy concerns constrained the translation of threats into action.
    
- **Resource/Time:** Lack of rapid deployment/decision mechanisms slowed the move from activation orders to combat.
    
- **Adversary adaptation:** Milosevic discounted NATO threats, believing that alliance politics would prevent escalation.

### **Chapter 8: Račak – and the Rambouillet Conference**

  

**Summary:**

Henriksen identifies the January 1999 Račak massacre as the critical moral and political inflection point that moved NATO from threats to serious consideration of war. Graphic evidence of Serb atrocities galvanized Western publics and hardened U.S. and European positions, making some form of decisive action politically necessary. Rambouillet was convened as the diplomatic mechanism to resolve the crisis, with a proposed autonomy and peacekeeping regime in Kosovo under NATO command. The Serb delegation rejected key elements, especially NATO’s demand for freedom of movement throughout Yugoslavia, while the Kosovar Albanian delegation was pressured heavily to accept. Henriksen argues that Rambouillet’s design and conduct reflected U.S. conviction that only force would move Milosevic and that NATO must run any post‑war security presence (pp. 107–109, 132). When Rambouillet failed and the KVM withdrew, NATO leaders saw their credibility and moral standing as on the line; the decision to initiate OAF followed rapidly. Yet true war aims and end‑state remained under‑specified even at this late stage.

  

**Key Points:**

- Račak crystallized the humanitarian frame and created a sense of moral urgency for intervention.
    
- Rambouillet’s terms, particularly NATO command of a peacekeeping force, were deliberately robust and unacceptable to Belgrade.
    
- The U.S. and some allies increasingly treated Rambouillet as a necessary prelude to force rather than an open‑ended negotiation.
    
- Kosovar Albanian leaders were pressed to accept terms they found imperfect, creating postwar expectations and grievances.
    
- The collapse of Rambouillet, combined with KVM withdrawal, made NATO’s earlier threats salient; inaction would have destroyed alliance credibility.
    
- Even at this point, senior military leaders later acknowledged there was no clear political strategy for what OAF should achieve beyond fuzzy notions of stopping violence (pp. 205–206).
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Legitimacy:** Račak and Rambouillet were crucial in constructing the humanitarian and legal‑political justification for war.
    
- **Alliance cohesion:** Rambouillet helped align NATO politically for action, but at the cost of hardened positions and limited flexibility.
    
- **Limits on airpower:** Despite impending use of force, there was still no clear linkage between air operations and desired political end‑state.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Legal/Normative:** Lack of UNSC authorization, reliance on humanitarian rationale, and contentious Rambouillet terms.
    
- **Political:** NATO credibility, public opinion, and moral expectations narrowed options to either war or humiliation.
    
- **Strategic:** Absence of defined postwar political settlement beyond broad autonomy under NATO protection.

### **Chapter 9: NATO Crisis Management in Perspective**

  

**Summary:**

This synthetic chapter argues that NATO’s handling of Kosovo was shaped far more by prior history—especially Bosnia—than by the actual dynamics on the ground in Kosovo (pp. 176–177, 206–207). Key U.S. actors (Albright, Vershbow, Clark, Gelbard, Holbrooke) believed from the outset that Milosevic was the problem, that force was necessary, and that NATO and airpower were the right tools—these were Bosnia lessons carried over (pp. 176–177). NATO issued threats early, driven by a combination of moral guilt, fear of another Bosnia, and a desire to demonstrate relevance, but without the political unity or military planning required to fulfill them (pp. 169–170, 176). As the crisis unfolded, the alliance became trapped by its own rhetoric; preserving NATO credibility became a political objective in itself. Henriksen also highlights the KLA’s cynical strategy: provoking Serb overreaction to generate international sympathy and eventual intervention (pp. 176–177). He concludes that coercive diplomacy requires careful manipulation of costs and benefits, which NATO mismanaged, creating incentives for both Milosevic and the KLA to take risks that made war more likely.

  

**Key Points:**

- U.S. and NATO policy toward Kosovo was driven heavily by Bosnia‑derived beliefs and emotions rather than careful analysis of Kosovo’s specifics (pp. 176–177).
    
- Early threats were politically attractive but militarily underprepared, leading to a spiral where preserving NATO credibility became central.
    
- The KLA deliberately pursued a strategy of escalation through suffering, expecting NATO to intervene on its behalf (pp. 176–177).
    
- NATO gradually reduced its criticism of the KLA and became a de facto ally, despite awareness of KLA responsibility for provocations.
    
- Misaligned incentives and poorly calibrated coercion pushed all parties toward confrontation rather than settlement.
    
- NATO’s crisis management illustrates how alliance politics, historical analogies, and moral narratives can overwhelm sober strategic calculation.
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Learning over time:** Strong path dependence from Bosnia and Desert Storm; limited adaption to Kosovo’s unique conditions.
    
- **Coercive diplomacy:** Failure to align threats, capabilities, and incentives for all parties; mismanagement of both coercion and counter‑coercion.
    
- **Alliance dynamics:** NATO’s need to maintain unity and credibility became an independent driver of escalation.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Political:** NATO’s credibility and cohesion became constraints, limiting compromise options and shaping escalation.
    
- **Strategic:** Mis‑set incentives encouraged the KLA and Milosevic to test NATO resolve rather than compromise.
    
- **Information:** Overreliance on analogies and narratives from Bosnia skewed perception of Kosovo’s strategic landscape.

### **Chapter 10: Diplomacy and Airpower (Epilogue)**

  

**Summary:**

In the epilogue, Henriksen assesses the interplay of diplomacy and airpower in OAF and reflects on what NATO’s “gamble” reveals about coercive airpower in limited wars. He contends that NATO’s crisis management was dominated by political pragmatism, not airpower theory; Bosnia’s shadow and alliance politics drove choices more than rational design of a coercive strategy (p. 230 ff.). Airpower was essential to the outcome: it inflicted real costs, signaled resolve, and revealed to Milosevic that time was not on his side. Yet airpower acted within, and was constrained by, a complex mix of Serbian domestic politics, Russian mediation, and the eventual emergence—however ambiguous—of a credible ground‑invasion possibility. Henriksen resists both triumphalist “airpower alone” narratives and dismissive accounts that minimize its role. Instead, he portrays OAF as a cautionary case: airpower can be a powerful coercive instrument, but only when integrated into a coherent political strategy that anticipates adversary adaptation and alliance constraints. For future limited wars, he warns against assuming that short, surgical strikes will replicate Kosovo’s outcome and urges richer understanding of coercive diplomacy’s demands.

  

**Key Points:**

- OAF’s strategy was shaped more by political pragmatism, alliance dynamics, and prior experiences than by systematic application of airpower theory.
    
- Airpower was decisive in the sense of being indispensable but not sufficient by itself; Serbian domestic factors and diplomacy also mattered.
    
- NATO’s initial gamble—expecting a few days of bombing to work—failed; success came only after sustained adaptation and escalation.
    
- The campaign underscored the difficulty of using airpower alone to coerce in complex political contexts, especially without clear end‑states.
    
- NATO’s experience holds lessons for future humanitarian interventions: airpower offers political flexibility, but overreliance without planning is dangerous.
    
- The alliance ultimately prevailed, but in a way that should temper, not reinforce, beliefs in easy, low‑cost “airpower solutions.”
    

  

**Cross‑Cutting Themes:**

- **Limits on airpower:** Political, legal, and alliance constraints shape what even technologically superior air forces can achieve.
    
- **Efficacy:** Tactical success plus political/moral narratives and opponent fragility together produced strategic success.
    
- **Learning:** OAF demonstrates the need for integrated political‑military planning and realistic expectations of coercive campaigns.
    

  

**Limits Map (mini):**

- **Strategic:** Lack of clear victory definition at the outset; eventual convergence around withdrawal of FRY forces and entry of KFOR.
    
- **Political:** Persistent need to maintain alliance cohesion and manage relations with Russia.
    
- **Adversary adaptation:** Serbian efforts at dispersion, deception, and political maneuvering required iterative targeting and diplomatic adjustment.

## **🧱 Limits Typology (case‑specific)**

  

Below: key limits, their origins, adjustability, level of effect, adaptations, and outcomes.

- **Alliance Politics & Credibility**
    
    - **Type:** Political; **Origin:** Exogenous (19 sovereign members) and endogenous (U.S. choice to push NATO leadership).
        
    - **Adjustability:** Partly relaxable via diplomacy; structurally persistent.
        
    - **Effect Level:** Strategic/operational.
        
    - **Adaptations:** NAC‑level consensus building, gradual expansion of target sets, careful messaging to publics and Russia.
        
    - **Outcome:** Slowed escalation, enforced gradualism, and pushed NATO into a credibility trap where preserving alliance prestige became a central war aim.
        
    
- **No‑Ground‑Forces Constraint**
    
    - **Type:** Political/Strategic.
        
    - **Origin:** Domestic casualty aversion and Powell‑doctrine legacy (U.S.) plus European reluctance.
        
    - **Adjustability:** Eventually slightly loosened by planning for ground options, but never fully reversed during OAF.
        
    - **Effect Level:** Strategic/operational.
        
    - **Adaptations:** Increased sortie rates, expanded target sets (infrastructure, Milosevic’s power base), rhetorical ambiguity about future ground invasion.
        
    - **Outcome:** Forced reliance on airpower alone; limited ability to execute Pape‑style denial against fielded forces; contributed to long campaign.
        
    
- **Legal/Normative Constraints**
    
    - **Type:** Legal/Normative.
        
    - **Origin:** International law, lack of UNSC authorization, humanitarian framing, domestic norms.
        
    - **Adjustability:** Limited; could not be ignored without major legitimacy costs.
        
    - **Effect Level:** Strategic/operational/tactical.
        
    - **Adaptations:** Emphasis on precision, careful BDA, avoidance of heavy punishment of civilians, emphasis on “dual‑use” but politically acceptable targets.
        
    - **Outcome:** Target set skewed toward infrastructure and regime symbols rather than maximum pain; reduced pure punishment but preserved legitimacy.
        
    
- **Doctrinal Focus on Decisive Major Theater War**
    
    - **Type:** Strategic/Operational/Organizational.
        
    - **Origin:** Endogenous to USAF doctrine and culture (Desert Storm legacy).
        
    - **Adjustability:** Over time; not in the short term.
        
    - **Effect Level:** Operational/strategic.
        
    - **Adaptations:** On‑the‑fly learning about coercive applications, use of Pape‑like logic by some planners, ad hoc shift toward denial of Serbian ground campaign where possible.
        
    - **Outcome:** Initial mismatch between doctrine and campaign design; contributed to confusion and frustration among air leaders.
        
    
- **Intelligence & Targeting Limitations**
    
    - **Type:** Intelligence/Information, Technological.
        
    - **Origin:** Exogenous (terrain, weather, opponent concealment) and endogenous (limited ISR focus on mobile targets).
        
    - **Adjustability:** Partially; improved ISR and tactics over time.
        
    - **Effect Level:** Tactical/operational.
        
    - **Adaptations:** Increased use of UAVs and JSTARS, focus on fixed infrastructure, development of TST (time‑sensitive targeting) processes.
        
    - **Outcome:** Limited success against dispersed fielded forces; high uncertainty about actual damage; reinforced reliance on political/infrastructural targeting for coercive effect.
        
    
- **Adversary Adaptation & Domestic Resilience**
    
    - **Type:** Adversary Adaptation, Political.
        
    - **Origin:** Exogenous; shaped by Milosevic’s reading of NATO and Serbian political culture.
        
    - **Adjustability:** Only via changing incentives (raising costs, undermining regime support, diplomacy).
        
    - **Effect Level:** Strategic/operational.
        
    - **Adaptations (NATO):** Targeting regime assets, propaganda outlets, and infrastructure tied to Milosevic’s power base; exploiting Russian mediation; hinting at ground options.
        
    - **Outcome:** Over time, combined military and political pressure eroded Milosevic’s support, making capitulation preferable to continued resistance.

## **📏 Measures of Effectiveness (MoE)**

- **What they tracked then:**
    
    - Number of sorties flown, PGMs expended, and target categories hit.
        
    - BDA on fixed targets (bridges, command centers, air defenses, infrastructure).
        
    - Visible Serbian military activity in Kosovo and FRY IADS behavior.
        
    - Refugee flows and humanitarian indicators (often as a political barometer rather than a strict MoE).
        
    - Signs of Serbian political movement (negotiating positions, signals via Russia).
        
    
- **Better MoE today (with rationale):**
    
    - **Coercive leverage metrics:** Changes in Milosevic’s coalition cohesion, regime elite dissent, and public unrest over time.
        
    - **Operational denial metrics:** Degree to which airpower impeded Serb operations against the KLA and civilians (e.g., sortie‑level data vs. ground activity).
        
    - **Alliance cohesion metrics:** NAC vote patterns, public opinion in key NATO states, and pace of escalation decisions.
        
    - **Adversary perception metrics:** Evidence of Milosevic’s evolving expectations about NATO resolve (e.g., negotiation behavior, intelligence intercepts).
        
    - These MoEs would better link tactical/operational outputs to strategic and political outcomes—Henriksen’s core concern.
        
    
- **Evidence summary:**
    
    - Airpower clearly destroyed numerous military and infrastructure targets and degraded FRY capacity, but its direct effect on ethnic cleansing was limited early on.
        
    - The cumulative effect of sustained bombing, economic disruption, regime‑targeted strikes, and Russian diplomatic pressure eventually shifted Belgrade’s cost–benefit calculus.
        
    - The campaign’s success relied as much on political erosion within Serbia and alliance persistence as on any single MoE like tonnage dropped.

## **🤷‍♂️ Actors & Perspectives**

  

### **U.S. Political Leadership (Clinton, Albright, NSC)**

- **Role / position:** Key strategic decision‑makers; drove NATO toward intervention and made major choices on ground‑force constraints.
    
- **Key perspectives / assumptions:** No “another Bosnia”; airpower is a low‑risk, politically controllable tool; NATO credibility and U.S. leadership must be preserved.
    
- **Evolution of stance:** Moved from threats and diplomacy to reluctant but determined war leadership; gradually accepted need for prolonged bombing and eventual ground planning.
    
- **Influence on outcomes:** Their initial air‑only “gamble” produced a poorly prepared campaign, but their persistence and incremental escalation were crucial to eventual coercive success.
    

  

### **U.S. Military Leadership (JCS, Krulak, Ralston, Short, Clark)**

- **Role / position:** Designed and executed OAF; advised on feasibility and limits of airpower.
    
- **Key perspectives / assumptions:** Doctrinal belief in decisive, well‑planned air campaigns; skepticism toward incremental, politically micromanaged bombing.
    
- **Evolution of stance:** Early frustration at lack of strategy and political constraints; over time, adapted by expanding target sets and re‑orienting toward pressure on Milosevic’s power base.
    
- **Influence on outcomes:** Operational adjustments improved coercive effect; candid after‑action critiques (e.g., “it was a mess,” lack of strategy) shaped later doctrinal debates (pp. 11, 205–206).
    

  

### **NATO Allies (European political leaders, NAC)**

- **Role / position:** Provided legitimacy, bases, and aircraft; constrained escalation and target choices.
    
- **Key perspectives / assumptions:** Humanitarian imperative vs. concern about legality, casualties, and escalation; dependence on U.S. leadership.
    
- **Evolution of stance:** Initially cautious and gradualist; hardened as atrocities and refugee flows mounted; eventually accepted wider targeting and semi‑credible ground option.
    
- **Influence on outcomes:** Made sustained bombing politically possible but ensured a slow, negotiated escalation curve that limited early coercive power.
    

  

### **Slobodan Milosevic & FRY Leadership**

- **Role / position:** Primary adversary; controlled Serbian political and military decision‑making.
    
- **Key perspectives / assumptions:** Based on Bosnia, believed NATO was risk‑averse and prone to bluff; expected to survive a short bombing campaign and leverage division in NATO.
    
- **Evolution of stance:** Initially defiant; accelerated ethnic cleansing under cover of NATO air; later shifted as bombing intensified, Russian support softened, and domestic costs grew.
    
- **Influence on outcomes:** His initial miscalculation made war inevitable; his eventual recognition of unsustainable costs enabled a settlement favorable to NATO’s core demands.
    

  

### **Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)**

- **Role / position:** Insurgent force representing militant Albanian nationalism.
    
- **Key perspectives / assumptions:** Violence and Serb reprisals would trigger NATO intervention; independence more important than short‑term suffering.
    
- **Evolution of stance:** From marginal insurgency to de facto NATO ally; later, postwar political actor.
    
- **Influence on outcomes:** Helped generate the crisis dynamics that made intervention politically unavoidable; complicated NATO’s neutrality and postwar governance.
    

  

### **Russia**

- **Role / position:** External patron of Serbia, UNSC veto holder, and potential spoiler.
    
- **Key perspectives / assumptions:** Opposed to NATO enlargement and intervention; wanted to protect Slavic/Serb interests and maintain regional influence.
    
- **Evolution of stance:** From rhetorical defender of Serbia to pragmatic broker once war costs mounted and NATO resolve proved durable.
    
- **Influence on outcomes:** Its eventual diplomatic engagement helped offer Milosevic an off‑ramp; its earlier stance limited NATO’s ability to seek UN authorization.

## **🕰 Timeline of Major Events**

- **1989-03** — **Kosovo’s autonomy revoked** — Serb authorities strip province of autonomy, setting stage for Albanian nonviolent resistance and future conflict.
    
- **1998-02-28** — **Drenica crackdown** — Killing of four Serb policemen and subsequent Serb operations push violence over threshold, drawing intense international attention (p. 12).
    
- **1998-06-15** — **NATO air exercise Determined Falcon** — Show‑of‑force flyover demonstrates NATO aircraft presence but, by Naumann’s account, teaches Milosevic that alliance threats lack near‑term execution capability (pp. 169–170).
    
- **1998-10** — **Holbrooke–Milosevic agreement & KVM deployment** — Threat‑backed diplomacy produces temporary de‑escalation, but also gives KLA and Serb forces space to re‑position; begins the pattern of threats without decisive follow‑through.
    
- **1999-01-15** — **Račak massacre** — Killing of Albanian civilians galvanizes Western opinion, making decisive action and a strong diplomatic move (Rambouillet) politically necessary.
    
- **1999-02–03** — **Rambouillet Conference** — Negotiations fail as Serbs reject key terms; Albanian delegation pressed into accepting; sets stage for NATO’s switch from coercive diplomacy to actual war.
    
- **1999-03-24** — **Start of Operation Allied Force** — NATO begins air strikes with B‑52‑launched cruise missiles and fighter sorties; intended as short coercive “signal” but becomes 78‑day campaign (pp. 205–206).
    
- **1999-04–05** — **Campaign expansion & Task Force Hawk** — NATO gradually widens target sets and begins planning for possible ground options, increasing perceived stakes for Belgrade.
    
- **1999-05** — **Intensification of strategic targeting** — Strikes on infrastructure, regime assets, and symbolic targets (e.g., TV station) underline escalation and internal political pressure on Milosevic.
    
- **1999-06-09–10** — **Kumanovo Agreement & end of OAF** — Milosevic accepts NATO terms; FRY forces withdraw, KFOR deploys, and bombing formally ends—an inflection point cementing OAF as a politically successful but messy coercive air campaign.

## **📖 Historiographical Context**

- Henriksen situates NATO’s Gamble within the broader debate over whether airpower can independently win wars or coerce adversaries, engaging with classic theorists and contemporary scholars like Robert Pape and Thomas Schelling (pp. 57–59, 82–84).
    
- He implicitly challenges triumphalist accounts such as those by John Keegan and Andrew Stigler that see Kosovo as a “clear victory for airpower” and proof of airpower’s stand‑alone coercive power.
    
- His narrative also contrasts with Benjamin Lambeth’s RAND study and Transformation of American Air Power, which emphasize the maturation and effectiveness of U.S. airpower, by emphasizing alliance politics, mis‑planning, and contingency.
    
- The book aligns partly with more skeptical works like Daniel Lake’s “The Limits of Coercive Airpower” and Byman & Waxman on coercive diplomacy by highlighting non‑military drivers of Milosevic’s capitulation.
    
- Methodologically, Henriksen adds value by combining high‑level interviews, policy documents, and theoretical framing to show how ideas and institutions shaped choices more than pure military logic.

## **🧩 Frameworks & Methods**

- **Theoretical frameworks:**
    
    - Coercive diplomacy (Schelling, Alexander George): manipulating costs/benefits to change adversary behavior without full‑scale war.
        
    - Pape’s coercive air strategy typology: punishment, risk, denial, decapitation (pp. 82–84).
        
    - Differing U.S.–European strategic cultures (e.g., Robert Kagan’s “Mars and Venus”) shaping attitudes toward power and force (p. xii).
        
    
- **Levels of analysis:**
    
    - **Strategic:** NATO war aims, alliance cohesion, legitimacy, Milosevic’s calculations.
        
    - **Operational:** Campaign design (phasing, target sets), integration of ISR/C2, adaptation over 78 days.
        
    - **Tactical:** Targeting practices, sortie generation, SEAD, and strike effectiveness.
        
    
- **Instruments & roles:**
    
    - **Airpower:** Strategic attack (infrastructure, regime assets), interdiction, limited CAS/strike against fielded forces, SEAD, ISR, and information warfare.
        
    - **Diplomacy:** Rambouillet, Russian mediation, Contact Group negotiations, alliance management.
        
    - **Information:** Media narratives (Račak, refugee flows, BDA), public diplomacy, and internal messaging.
        
    
- **Sources & methods:**
    
    - Extensive semi‑structured interviews with U.S., NATO, and European officials (civilian and military).
        
    - Official documents, after‑action reports, memoirs, and secondary scholarship.
        
    - Process tracing of decisions across 1998–1999, highlighting key decision points and path dependency.

## **🔄 Learning Over Time (within the book & vs. prior SAASS 628 cases)**

- **What shifted during OAF:**
    
    - NATO moved from an expectation of a short, symbolic air campaign to acceptance of a prolonged, escalatory coercive campaign.
        
    - Targeting shifted from air defenses and limited military infrastructure toward regime power bases and critical infrastructure.
        
    - Political leaders slowly recognized the need for at least the appearance of a credible ground option.
        
    
- **What persisted:**
    
    - Domestic casualty aversion and reluctance to commit ground forces remained strong throughout.
        
    - Alliance consensus requirements continued to shape targeting decisions and campaign pacing.
        
    - The belief in airpower as the “manageable” way to use force persisted, even as its limits became apparent.
        
    
- **What was (mis)learned:**
    
    - From Bosnia: Overconfidence in short air campaigns and NATO leadership; underestimation of adversary resolve and political complexity.
        
    - From Desert Storm: Misapplied assumptions about the speed and decisiveness of air campaigns in very different political contexts.
        
    - For later cases (e.g., Libya 2011): OAF reinforced the seductive idea that airpower can “solve” crises without ground commitments—lessons later problematized by post‑intervention instability.

## **🧐 Critical Reflections**

- **Strengths:**
    
    - Rich integration of theory, history, and interviews provides a nuanced understanding of how airpower was actually used and constrained.
        
    - Corrects simplistic “airpower alone” narratives by foregrounding alliance politics, path dependency, and coercive diplomacy dynamics.
        
    - Highlights the often‑ignored role of the KLA and internal Serbian politics in shaping outcomes.
        
    
- **Weaknesses / blind spots:**
    
    - Less detailed tactical analysis of air operations compared to Lambeth—ISR, specific platforms, and micro‑level targeting are not the focus.
        
    - Serbian internal politics, while discussed, could be further explored with indigenous sources beyond Western accounts.
        
    - Limited exploration of post‑1999 developments (UNMIK, KFOR, later violence), which would further test the long‑term strategic efficacy of OAF.
        
    
- **Unresolved questions:**
    
    - To what extent could a different initial strategy (clearer war aims, early credible ground threat) have shortened the campaign or reduced suffering?
        
    - How much of Milosevic’s capitulation is attributable to airpower vs. internal political decay and Russian mediation?
        
    - Are Kosovo‑style air‑only interventions replicable elsewhere, or was OAF a unique confluence of vulnerabilities?

## **⚔️ Comparative Insights (link to prior course readings)**

- **Vs. Lambeth, Transformation of American Air Power:**
    
    - Lambeth emphasizes the transformation of U.S. airpower into a precise, flexible, and increasingly decisive joint instrument, seeing OAF as a key proof of concept. Henriksen, while acknowledging technological prowess, stresses the political and strategic messiness and the extent to which NATO prevailed despite poor initial strategy. Lambeth is more bullish on airpower’s independent efficacy; Henriksen is more skeptical and context‑dependent.
        
    
- **Vs. Pape, Bombing to Win (if covered):**
    
    - Pape argues coercive airpower rarely works without denial effects supporting ground forces. Kosovo appears to be a partial counterexample: there was no major NATO ground offensive, yet coercion succeeded. Henriksen’s account, however, aligns with Pape’s caution by showing that success depended on internal Serbian politics and multi‑dimensional pressure, not bombing alone.
        
    
- **Vs. Vietnam air campaigns (Clodfelter/others):**
    
    - Vietnam showed the failure of gradual, politically constrained bombing to coerce; Kosovo shows a constrained campaign that eventually succeeded, but only under very favorable conditions (small adversary, alliance persistence, internal regime fragility). The contrast highlights both continuity in political limits and variability in outcomes.

## **❓ Open Questions (for seminar)**

1. **What lessons did American strategists draw about air employment from their experiences of the 1990s?**
    
    - From Desert Storm and Deliberate Force, many U.S. strategists concluded that precision airpower could deliver rapid, low‑cost strategic effects, often framed as decisive or near‑decisive. They saw airpower as a versatile tool for coercive diplomacy, capable of sending calibrated “signals” while avoiding large ground deployments (pp. 12–13, 57–59, 82–84). Bosnia reinforced the idea that NATO airpower plus diplomatic pressure could force Balkan leaders to negotiate, while the Powell doctrine and Somalia pushed them to avoid large ground operations. These experiences together produced a belief that a short, politically controlled bombing campaign could coerce Milosevic in Kosovo, with airpower as the primary instrument.
        
    
2. **What lessons did the Milosevic regime draw from those same experiences?**
    
    - From Bosnia, Milosevic learned that Western threats were often delayed, divided, and constrained by legal and alliance politics. He saw that NATO and the UN frequently bluffed or hesitated, and that force, once applied, was often limited and negotiable. Early NATO threats and exercises like Determined Falcon, followed by delayed or limited action, further convinced him that NATO lacked the unity and will for a rapid, forceful intervention (pp. 169–170, 176–177). These lessons led him to discount early air threats in 1999, to believe he could outlast a short bombing campaign, and to use ethnic cleansing and refugees as tools to manipulate Western politics.
        
    
3. **What limits did American airpower operate under during OAF?**
    
    - Politically, U.S. airpower was constrained by alliance consensus (19 members, each with caveats), domestic casualty aversion, and an upfront ruling out of ground combat. Legally and normatively, NATO lacked a UNSC mandate and had to frame attacks within humanitarian and proportionality norms, restricting pure punishment of civilians and limiting infrastructure targeting. Strategically, there was no clear end‑state or theory of victory: “stop the killing” and “get Serb forces out” were too vague to guide a coherent campaign (pp. 11, 57, 205–206). Operationally, limitations included weather, terrain, dispersed Serb forces, ISR constraints, and target‑approval bottlenecks. Together, these limits forced a gradual, politically micromanaged campaign that often diverged from what airmen regarded as optimal.
        
    
4. **How effective was American airpower in OAF?**
    
    - Tactically, U.S. airpower achieved high sortie rates, destroyed a significant portion of FRY’s fixed infrastructure and some military assets, and suppressed air defenses enough to operate with low loss rates. Operationally, it constrained FRY military freedom of movement, increased costs of sustaining operations in Kosovo, and signaled NATO’s willingness to escalate. Strategically and politically, airpower alone did not immediately stop ethnic cleansing or compel Milosevic, but its sustained application, combined with economic pain, targeted strikes on regime assets, internal political erosion, and Russian mediation, eventually convinced him that continuing the war was worse than conceding. In Henriksen’s view, airpower was necessary but not sufficient: it was a critical component of a broader coercive environment rather than a standalone silver bullet.
        
    
5. **How do Stigler’s conclusions differ from those of Lambeth in Transformation of American Air Power?**
    
    - Andrew Stigler, in “A Clear Victory for Air Power,” argues that the threat of continued and intensified NATO bombing was the only necessary military condition for Milosevic’s capitulation; he dismisses the ground‑invasion threat as empty and essentially irrelevant. Lambeth, in Transformation of American Air Power and his RAND study, sees Kosovo as an important demonstration of transformed U.S. airpower—stealth, precision, and information dominance—but emphasizes that airpower’s role must be understood within a broader political and strategic context; in his RAND assessment he notes that airpower was not the sole factor but “set the stage” for surrender. Stigler thus offers a more maximalist claim about airpower’s independent coercive efficacy, while Lambeth offers a more moderate view that stresses airpower’s centrality but acknowledges the importance of other factors (domestic Serbian politics, diplomacy, and evolving ground options). Henriksen’s narrative tends to align more with Lambeth’s moderate position, further emphasizing alliance politics and mis‑planning.

- “When the most powerful military alliance in history entered its first war, no one in the military leadership of NATO had received any political guidance or developed any strategy for what the situation in Kosovo should be like after the war.” (p. 11) — Captures the core strategic vacuum at OAF’s outset.
    
- “In effect, NATO had not planned for the war it was about to start.” (p. 11) — Summarizes the book’s starting puzzle.
    
- General Jean‑Pierre Kelche: “It was no political direction in the beginning—absent… in the beginning—it was a mess.” (p. 11–12) — Senior allied military testimony confirming political disarray.
    
- Lord David Owen on NATO’s “show of force”: “Their bluff was called by Milošević. That’s what happened.” (p. 13) — Encapsulates the “gamble” metaphor and miscalculation.
    
- “The challenge in the Kosovo War, however, was not to fight a high‑intensity war but to find a way to incorporate airpower in a politically constrained strategy of coercive diplomacy.” (p. 57) — Key conceptual pivot from decisive to coercive airpower.

## **🧾 Final‑Paper Hooks**

- **Claim 1:** _Operation Allied Force demonstrates that coercive airpower can succeed in a limited war, but only when combined with alliance persistence, adversary political vulnerabilities, and supportive diplomacy; airpower alone was neither necessary nor sufficient in the strict sense._
    
    - **Evidence/quotes/pages:** Introduction on unpreparedness (pp. 11–13); Chapter 2 on coercive airpower theory (pp. 57–59, 82–84); Chapter 9 on Bosnia‑driven strategy and internal Serbian politics (pp. 176–177, 205–207).
        
    - **Counterarguments:** Stigler’s claim of airpower alone; Lambeth’s emphasis on transformed airpower; need to show how Serbian domestic politics and Russian mediation interacted with bombing.
        
    
- **Claim 2:** _NATO’s Kosovo strategy was less a deliberate application of airpower theory than a politically driven improvisation shaped by mis‑learned lessons from Bosnia, demonstrating the dangers of analogy‑based strategy in limited wars._
    
    - **Evidence:** Chapter 4 on Bosnia lessons (pp. 107–109, 132); Chapter 5–9 on the transfer of crisis management to NATO, repeated threats, and credibility traps (pp. 140–141, 153, 169–170, 176–177).
        
    - **Counterarguments:** Arguments that Bosnia provided valid templates (e.g., Deliberate Force) and that NATO’s incremental strategy was an intentional “risk” approach.
        
    
- **Claim 3:** _The main limiting factor on U.S./NATO airpower in Kosovo was not technology or doctrine but alliance politics and political risk aversion, which forced a gradualist campaign that airmen themselves considered suboptimal._
    
    - **Evidence:** Airpower debate chapter (p. 57); testimonies from Short, Krulak, Ralston, and Kelche (pp. 11–12, 57, 205–206); repeated target‑approval and threat‑credibility problems (pp. 169–170, 176–177).
        
    - **Counterarguments:** View that gradualism was strategically necessary for alliance cohesion and legitimacy; need to explore whether a more “classic” air campaign was politically feasible at all.
        
    

  

These hooks can be woven into a broader SAASS 628 final paper comparing Kosovo with other 1990s air campaigns, interrogating the “Kosovo model,” and testing claims about the independent coercive power of airpower in limited wars.
