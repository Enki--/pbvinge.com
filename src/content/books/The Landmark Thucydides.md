## Reading Questions Day One

### **1. What are the causes of the Peloponnesian War?**

Thucydides famously claims that the truest cause of the war — though not stated openly — was the growth of Athenian power and the fear this inspired in Sparta (Book 1.23). This structural explanation aligns with modern theories of power transition and the security dilemma. However, immediate causes included disputes over Corcyra, Potidaea, and economic sanctions on Megara. These flashpoints exposed the brittle diplomatic framework of the Greek world and revealed deep-seated tensions between democratic Athens and oligarchic Sparta. Thucydides presents both proximate events and underlying fears as part of a comprehensive causal model, emphasizing how power, pride, and perceived injustice interact to precipitate war.

---

### **2. How would you assess the elected Athenian leader, Pericles, as a strategist? The Spartan king, Archidamus?**

Pericles stands out as a strategic realist: he understood Athenian strengths — naval power, economic might, and imperial cohesion — and crafted a defensive strategy built on avoiding pitched battles with Sparta. His "Periclean Strategy" aimed to preserve Athenian power by protracting the war and avoiding overextension. Thucydides praises Pericles’ vision, suggesting that had Athens followed his counsel throughout, it might not have lost. In contrast, King Archidamus II is portrayed as cautious and deliberative, advocating restraint in the face of popular Spartan agitation for war. While not charismatic, he is sensible, recognizing the economic and logistical challenges of defeating a maritime empire like Athens. Both leaders embody prudence, but their more aggressive successors ultimately drive escalation.

---

### **3. How does a combatant dominant in one domain battle an opponent dominant in a different domain?**

Thucydides' history presents a classic asymmetric contest: Athens excels at naval operations and economic projection, while Sparta dominates on land with its hoplite armies and Peloponnesian League allies. Each side attempts to leverage its strengths while exploiting the other's vulnerabilities. The Athenians avoid pitched land battles and use their fleet for raiding and containment; the Spartans ravage Attica and encourage revolts in Athenian-controlled regions. Success in such a conflict depends on adaptability, logistics, and maintaining cohesion across different theaters. Thucydides shows that when one side ventures into the other’s domain — as Athens does disastrously in Sicily — the results can be catastrophic.

---

### **4. What is Thucydides’ purpose in writing this book?**

Thucydides explicitly states that he wrote the *History of the Peloponnesian War* as “a possession for all time,” not just for contemporary readers. His goal was to capture the underlying truths of human nature, politics, and conflict, rather than merely chronicling events. By emphasizing cause and effect, speeches, and the behavior of states and individuals under pressure, he creates a rigorous analytic history grounded in rationalism. Thucydides aspires to reveal how fear, honor, and interest drive international affairs — insights meant to endure long after the particulars of his era have faded. In this sense, his work is both a history and a political science treatise.

---

### **5. What is “The Thucydides Trap”?**

“The Thucydides Trap” is a modern concept popularized by political scientist Graham Allison, drawn from Thucydides’ insight that rising powers create fear in established ones, leading to war. The idea suggests that when a dominant power (like Sparta) is challenged by an emerging rival (like Athens), the structural stress makes conflict likely — even if neither side desires it. While not a term Thucydides himself used, the “trap” reflects his diagnosis of the war’s deeper causes and has become a lens through which contemporary geopolitical rivalries (e.g., U.S.–China) are analyzed. It underscores the enduring relevance of Thucydides’ analysis in explaining how great power transitions can destabilize international systems.

## Reading Questions Day Two

### **1. What is the significance of the Melian Dialogue?**

The Melian Dialogue (Book 5) is a dramatic and philosophical centerpiece of Thucydides’ *History*, where Athenian envoys coldly justify the subjugation of neutral Melos by appealing to power rather than justice. It represents a stark exposition of realpolitik: the Athenians argue that “the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must,” stripping diplomacy of its moral pretense. Thucydides uses this episode to expose the contradictions within Athenian imperial ideology and to interrogate the ethical limits of power. The dialogue’s form — a stylized debate — heightens its theatricality and detachment, underscoring the moral vacuum that emerges in a system governed solely by fear and expediency. Ultimately, it serves as a warning about the corrosive effects of empire on both the oppressed and the oppressor.

---

### **2. Why does Athens go to war with a fellow democracy, Syracuse? What is the cause of the fateful outcome of the Sicilian expedition?**

Athens’ campaign against Syracuse in Book 6–7, despite Syracuse being a fellow democracy, reflects the expansive logic of Athenian imperialism rather than ideological opposition. Thucydides suggests that ambition, fear of losing influence, and internal demagoguery — particularly from Alcibiades — drove Athens to overreach. The Sicilian Expedition ends disastrously due to poor strategic planning, the recall and defection of Alcibiades, internal factionalism, and underestimation of both Syracuse and its Spartan allies. The Athenians’ logistical failures, compounded by a lack of naval retreat options and the psychological demoralization of their forces, culminate in total annihilation. This defeat marks a turning point, draining Athens of manpower, ships, and prestige — a prelude to its eventual collapse.

---

### **3. Why does Athens lose the Peloponnesian War? How does Sparta win?**

Athens loses the Peloponnesian War because it overextends its imperial reach while simultaneously facing internal political instability, plague, and attrition. Thucydides shows how Athens' reliance on aggressive maritime power could not be sustained against protracted land-based resistance and shifting alliances. Sparta, traditionally conservative and land-based, adapts under the leadership of Lysander, embracing naval warfare and securing Persian financial support — a critical pivot. Sparta’s victory at Aegospotami in 405 BC, made possible by superior logistics, internal Athenian exhaustion, and external funding, breaks Athenian supply lines and forces surrender. Thucydides’ narrative suggests that Athens was not defeated solely by Sparta, but by the cumulative pressures of war, internal dissent, and hubris.

---

### **4. Why did George Marshall say that understanding the Peloponnesian War is essential to understanding modern international issues?**

George Marshall’s invocation of the Peloponnesian War reflects Thucydides’ enduring relevance as a foundational thinker on power politics, war, and the fragility of democracy. The war encapsulates perennial tensions in international relations: the security dilemma, the dangers of overreach, the role of alliances, and the moral compromises of great powers. Thucydides does not merely chronicle events but provides a framework for analyzing how fear, honor, and interest drive conflict — insights that resonate in the bipolar world of the Cold War and beyond. Marshall likely viewed the fall of Athens not just as a historical tragedy, but as a cautionary tale for any liberal power tempted to sacrifice principle for expediency. Studying the Peloponnesian War, then, is a means of cultivating strategic wisdom grounded in historical precedent.

## 🔫 Author Background

- **Thucydides** ([/θjuːˈsɪdɪˌdiːz/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [_thew-SID-ih-deez_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"); [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): [Θουκυδίδης](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%98%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BA%CF%85%CE%B4%CE%AF%CE%B4%CE%B7%CF%82#Ancient_Greek "wikt:Θουκυδίδης"), [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Ancient_Greek "Romanization of Ancient Greek"): __Thoukudídēs__ [[tʰuːkydǐdɛːs]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Greek "Help:IPA/Greek"); c. 460 – c. 400 BC) was an [Athenian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Athens "Classical Athens") historian and general. His _[History of the Peloponnesian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War "History of the Peloponnesian War")_ recounts [the fifth-century BC war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War "Peloponnesian War")between [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta "Sparta") and [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens "Athens") until the year 411 BC. Thucydides has been dubbed the father of "[scientific history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_history "Scientific history")" by those who accept his claims to have applied strict standards of impartiality and evidence-gathering and analysis of cause and effect, without reference to intervention by the [gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_religion "Ancient Greek religion"), as outlined in his introduction to his work.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides#cite_note-Cochrane-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides#cite_note-5)

- Thucydides has been called the father of the school of [political realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_realism "Political realism"), which views the political behavior of individuals and the subsequent outcomes of relations between states as ultimately mediated by, and constructed upon, [fear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear "Fear") and [self-interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-interest "Self-interest").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides#cite_note-6) His text is still studied at universities and military colleges worldwide.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides#cite_note-7) The [Melian dialogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melian_dialogue "Melian dialogue") is regarded as a seminal text of [international relations theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations_theory "International relations theory"), while his version of [Pericles's Funeral Oration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles%27s_Funeral_Oration "Pericles's Funeral Oration") is widely studied by political theorists, historians, and students of the [classics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics "Classics"). More generally, Thucydides developed an understanding of [human nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nature "Human nature") to explain behavior in such crises as [plagues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_\(disease\) "Plague (disease)"), massacres, and wars.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides#cite_note-8)

## The Historian’s Purpose and Method (1.1-1.23)

[Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) begins by stating his intention to write a history of the war between the Peloponnesians and the Athenians, which he believed would be the greatest war in history`246`. In a section often called the "**Archaeology**," he argues that ancient Hellas was weak and decentralized, and that even the famed Trojan War was a minor affair compared to the [Peloponnesian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War)`252, 288, 326`.

He then outlines his Historical Method, emphasizing his commitment to accuracy. He claims to have based his account on his own observations and on reports he verified with "the most severe and detailed tests possible"`398`. Regarding the Thucydidean Speeches, he admits they are not verbatim but are composed to reflect the "general sense" of what was said and what the situation demanded`398`.

Finally, [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) identifies two levels of causation for the war. While specific disputes served as pretexts, he states the "real cause" was a matter of Realpolitik:
> The real cause... was the growth of the power of [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens), and the alarm which this inspired in [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta), which in his view, "made war inevitable"`404`.

This concept of Spartan Fear is central to his entire history.

---
## First Pretext: The Affair of Corcyra (1.24-1.55)

The first dispute arose from a civil conflict in Epidamnus, a colony of Corcyra`406`. When Corcyra (itself a Corinthian colony) refused to help, Epidamnus appealed to [Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth)`414`. [Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth), resenting Corcyra's arrogance and independence, agreed to intervene`414`.

This led to a naval battle where [Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth) was defeated`461`. Fearing retaliation, the Corcyraeans abandoned their isolationist policy and appealed to [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) for an alliance`478, 480`. This prompted a debate in the Athenian assembly:
- **The Corcyraeans argued** that war with the Peloponnesus was unavoidable and that [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) needed Corcyra's powerful fleet`483, 497`.
- **The Corinthians warned** that an alliance would violate the Thirty Years' Peace and force a state of war`508, 512`.

[Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) chose a compromise: a purely defensive alliance (`epimachia`)`530, 532`. At the subsequent Battle of Sybota, the small Athenian fleet intervened to prevent a Corcyraean collapse`579`. [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) concludes that this intervention was the "first cause of the war that [Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth) had against the Athenians"`596`.

---
## Second Pretext: The Affair of Potidaea (1.56-1.66)

Immediately after, [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) grew suspicious of Potidaea, a Corinthian colony that was also a tribute-paying member of the Athenian Empire`597`. Fearing a rebellion backed by [Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth) and King Perdiccas of Macedonia, [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) demanded Potidaea tear down its walls`597`. After receiving a secret promise of support from [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta), Potidaea revolted`610`. [Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth) sent aid, and [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) responded by laying siege to the city in the Siege of Potidaea`614, 645, 657`, creating another major grievance`653`.

---
## The Debates at [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) and the Vote for War (1.67-1.88)

[Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth) and its allies convened at [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) to accuse [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) of breaking the Thirty Years' Peace`663`. This led to a series of foundational speeches defining the conflict:
- **The Corinthians** rebuked [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) for its slowness, contrasting it with the innovative, expansionist nature of [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens)`675, 678`.
- **Athenian envoys** defended their empire, arguing it was acquired justly after [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) abandoned the Persian Wars. They claimed they maintained it out of Fear, Honor, and Interest, and warned that [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) would be just as oppressive if given the power`688, 700, 701, 705`.
- **King Archidamus of [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta)** advised caution, warning that a war against the wealthy, naval-savvy [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) would be long and difficult. He urged diplomacy and preparation`715, 716, 719`.
- **The ephor Sthenelaidas** gave a short, sharp speech rejecting deliberation and demanding an immediate vote for war to defend [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta)'s allies and honor`733`.

The Spartan assembly, moved by Sthenelaidas, voted for war`736`. But [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) reiterates that they voted "because they feared the growth of the power of the Athenians"`745`.

---
## Final Negotiations and [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles)' Counsel (1.139-1.146)

[Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) sent several embassies with escalating demands, culminating in an ultimatum to "let the Hellenes be independent"`923`. In the final Athenian assembly, [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles) gave his decisive counsel:
- He argued for a firm policy of **no concessions**, stating that yielding on a small point would only invite greater demands`923, 924`.
- He advised the Athenians to rely on their financial strength and Athenian Naval Supremacy.
- If necessary, they should abandon the land of Attica to invaders and fight the war from the sea, a strategy of asymmetrical warfare`926`.

Following his advice, [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) rejected the ultimatum but offered arbitration, as stipulated by the treaty`927`. [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) refused, and both sides understood war was now imminent`927`.

## The Outbreak of War at Plataea (2.1-2.6)

The [Peloponnesian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War) begins with a surprise attack by Thebes on its Athenian-allied neighbor, Plataea. Acting with a pro-Theban faction, 300 Thebans enter the city, breaking the Thirty Years' Peace. The Plataeans, realizing the small size of the force, launch a coordinated counterattack, moving undetected by digging through the walls of their houses. They capture 180 prisoners. Despite promising their safe return, the Plataeans execute all the captives after a larger Theban relief force withdraws. This brutal act sets the tone for the war's ferocity.

---
## First Invasion of Attica and [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles)' Strategy (2.7-2.24)

With war now openly declared, [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta)'s King King Archidamus leads a large Peloponnesian army to invade Attica. In [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens), [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles) convinces the citizens to adopt the **Periclean Strategy**:
- Abandon the countryside and bring all property and people inside the city's Long Walls`8`.
- Avoid a pitched land battle with the superior Spartan army at all costs.
- Rely on Athenian Naval Supremacy and financial reserves for victory.

The Peloponnesians ravage Attica and encamp at Acharnae, enraging the Athenians, who demand to fight. [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles) holds firm, refusing to call an assembly and instead dispatches a fleet of 100 ships to raid the Peloponnesian coast. After 40 days, the invaders withdraw.

## [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles)' Funeral Oration (2.34-2.46)

At the public funeral for the first year's war dead, [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles) delivers the famous Funeral Oration. Instead of simple eulogy, he praises the society for which the soldiers died.

### Athenian Democracy
He extols [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens)' unique constitution, which "favors the many instead of the few" and provides equal justice for all. Advancement is based on merit, not wealth or class.

### Athenian Character
He describes Athenians as balancing freedom with civic duty, tolerant in private but obedient to public law. He contrasts the open, versatile, and naturally courageous Athenian spirit with the rigid, secretive, and laborious military training of [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta).

### A City Worth Dying For
He concludes that [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) is "**the school of Hellas**," a city whose power and glory make it worthy of the ultimate sacrifice. He comforts the families, urging them to find solace in the honor their loved ones earned.

---
## The Plague in [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) (2.47-2.54)

In the war's second summer, the devastating Plague in [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) strikes the overcrowded city. [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides), a survivor, provides a clinical, detailed account of its symptoms and extreme deadliness. The plague's effects are magnified by the population density caused by the Periclean Strategy. He observes a complete moral collapse:
> [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) observes a catastrophic breakdown of social and moral order, as citizens, facing imminent death, abandon all fear of "gods or law of man" and live only for the pleasure of the moment.

---
## The Leadership of [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles) and Phormio's Victories (2.55-2.103)

Under the dual pressures of plague and a second Spartan invasion, the Athenians blame [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles). In a final speech, he chastises their weakness, reminding them that the Athenian empire is a "tyranny" that cannot be safely surrendered and that their naval power ensures ultimate security. Persuaded, they recommit to the war but fine him personally.

[Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles) dies soon after. [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) delivers his famous assessment that under [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles), [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) was a democracy in name but in reality was a rule by its first citizen. He argues [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles)' successors lacked his foresight, leading to the city's eventual ruin.

Meanwhile, in the west, the Athenian admiral Phormio, with only 20 ships at Naupactus, twice defeats a much larger Peloponnesian fleet in the Gulf of [Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth). He uses brilliant Naval Tactics, including superior knowledge of local winds and a sudden, decisive maneuver, to rout fleets of 47 and 77 ships, respectively.

**Tags:** #[Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) #BookSummary #Book3 #PeloponnesianWar #MytilenianDebate #Stasis #Cleon #Diodotus #Demosthenes

## The Revolt of Mytilene and the Athenian Response (3.1-3.35)

In the war's fourth year, the city of Mytilene on Lesbos revolted from [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens). This was a grave threat, as Lesbos was a rare ally that still contributed ships to the Athenian Empire, not just money. The Mytilenians argued at Olympia that [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) had turned the [Delian League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delian_League) into a tyranny and their rebellion was an act of liberation.

[Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) accepted Lesbos into its alliance but was stunned by [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens)' decisive response`995`. Despite the plague, [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) blockaded Mytilene and simultaneously raided the Peloponnesian coast, demonstrating shocking naval capacity. The Athenian general Paches completed the siege. A Peloponnesian relief fleet under the admiral Alcidas arrived too late; Mytilene had already fallen.

---
## The Mytilenian Debate in [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) (3.36-3.50)

The starving common people of Mytilene, newly armed by their oligarchs, forced a surrender to Paches. In [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens), the enraged assembly, on the motion of Cleon, voted to execute the entire adult male population and enslave the women and children.

The next day, a second assembly was called to reconsider this "horrid cruelty," leading to the famous Mytilenian Debate.

### Cleon's Speech
[Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) describes Cleon as "the most violent man at [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens)." Cleon argued that the empire was a despotism and that justice demanded a harsh punishment to deter future rebellions. He claimed that showing pity or "softness of heart" was a weakness fatal to empire.

### Diodotus's Speech
Diodotus countered that the debate was not about justice but about Athenian self-interest. He argued an extreme penalty would make future rebels fight to the death, making sieges more costly. By sparing the common people (the *demos*), who had surrendered the city, [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) could use them as allies against oligarchic factions in other cities.

Diodotus's argument won by a narrow margin. A second trireme was sent, arriving just in time to stop the massacre. The 1,000 Mytilenians deemed most responsible were still executed, and [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) confiscated the city's land and walls.

---
## The Fall of Plataea (3.20-3.24; 3.52-3.68)

The Siege of Plataea reached its grim conclusion. After a daring winter escape by some of the garrison, the starving remainder surrendered to the Spartans. The Spartans held a sham trial, asking only if the Plataeans had served [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) in the current war. The Plataeans appealed to their heroic service during the Persian Wars, while the Thebans accused them of betrayal and murder. The Spartans executed every man—over 200 Plataeans and 25 Athenians—and allowed Thebes to raze the city.

---
## Civil War in Corcyra and [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides)' Analysis of *Stasis* (3.70-3.85)

The Corcyrean Civil War erupted when oligarchs, released by [Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth), returned to assassinate democratic leaders. The city descended into brutal street fighting between oligarchs and democrats ("The People"). The arrival of an Athenian fleet under Eurymedon secured a democratic victory, which was followed by a savage, seven-day massacre of their opponents.

Taking this as his paradigm, [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) offers a profound analysis of the pathology of **Stasis (Civil War)**.
> In such conflicts, "words had to change their ordinary meaning," with "reckless audacity" being called courage and "prudent hesitation" being called cowardice. Party loyalty replaced family ties... He attributes this breakdown of society to the "lust for power arising from greed and ambition".

---
## Demosthenes' Campaigns in Western Greece (3.94-3.114)

The Athenian general Demosthenes launched an ill-advised invasion of the rugged region of Aetolia. His army of heavily armed hoplites was no match for the local Light-Armed Troops and was decisively defeated. To capitalize, [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) sent an army under Eurylochus to attack the key Athenian base of Naupactus.

Demosthenes, however, redeemed himself by saving Naupactus with reinforcements from Acarnania. Later, at the Battle of Olpae, he used a clever ambush to defeat a Peloponnesian army. He then ambushed a second army of Ambraciots at Idomene, inflicting what [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) calls the "greatest disaster" to befall any single Greek city in the war.

## The Campaign at Pylos and Sphacteria (4.2-4.41)

In the seventh year of the war, the Athenian general Demosthenes, aboard a fleet bound for Sicily, persuaded the soldiers to fortify the harbor of Pylos in Messenia. The Spartan army, then invading Attica, immediately withdrew to attack the new fort.

The Spartans landed 420 hoplites under Epitadas on the island of Sphacteria, which commands the harbor, intending to blockade the Athenians. However, their assault on the fort at Pylos failed, despite the bravery of [Brasidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasidas). The Athenian fleet then returned, defeated the Peloponnesian ships, and trapped the Spartan force on the island.

This unexpected disaster caused panic in [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta). They sued for peace, offering an alliance for the return of their men. The Athenians, urged on by the demagogue Cleon, made excessive demands, and the negotiations failed.

The siege of Sphacteria dragged on. In [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens), Cleon deflected blame by rashly promising to capture the Spartans within twenty days. When his rival, the general [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias), called his bluff, Cleon was forced to accept the command.

At Pylos, a fire providentially cleared the island's woods. Demosthenes then landed his army, using a new tactic: thousands of **Light-Armed Troops** (archers, slingers) harassed the Spartan hoplites with missiles, refusing to engage in close-quarters Hoplite Warfare. Worn down and unable to close with their mobile enemy, the Spartans retreated and were surrounded. The survivors, including about 120 elite Spartiates, surrendered—an unprecedented event. Cleon returned to [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) in triumph.

> [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) remarks that "nothing that happened in the war surprised the Hellenes so much as this".

## [Brasidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasidas)'s Campaign in Thrace (4.78-4.88; 4.102-4.116)

To retaliate, [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) sent its most dynamic general, **[Brasidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasidas)**, overland to the Thracian region. His mission was to use a small army of Helots and mercenaries to encourage [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens)'s allies to revolt.

His campaign was a stunning success. At Acanthus, he used a combination of persuasive rhetoric (presenting [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) as the **Liberator of Hellas**) and implied threats to incite a revolt. His greatest prize was the vital Athenian colony of **Amphipolis**, which he captured by a surprise attack.

The Athenian relief fleet, commanded by the historian **[Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides)** (stationed at nearby Thasos), arrived too late to save the city. This failure resulted in **[Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides)' Exile**, during which he wrote his history. [Brasidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasidas)'s moderate conduct and success inspired many other cities, like Torone, to revolt.

## The [Battle of Delium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Delium) (4.89-4.101)

The Athenians attempted a complex invasion of Boeotia, which failed in its main objectives. However, an Athenian army under Hippocrates did occupy the temple at Delium. As they retreated, the Boeotian army, led by the Theban Pagondas, attacked.

At the **[Battle of Delium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Delium)**, the Boeotians were victorious. Their use of a **Deep Phalanx** on their right wing proved decisive, and a surprise cavalry charge routed the Athenians, who suffered nearly 1,000 casualties. The Boeotians later used a unique flame-throwing device in their final assault on the fortified temple.

---
## The One-Year Armistice and Continued Conflict (4.117-4.135)

Shaken by their defeat at Delium and worried by [Brasidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasidas)'s successes, [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) was now more inclined toward peace. The Spartans, desperate to recover the prisoners from Sphacteria, were equally eager.

In the spring of 423 BC, they agreed to a **One-Year Armistice (423 BC)** to negotiate. [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) provides the full text of the agreement. However, the truce was immediately strained when the city of Scione revolted to [Brasidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasidas) just after it was sworn. Mende soon followed, leading to renewed fighting in Thrace as [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) sent an army under [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias) to besiege the rebellious cities.

## The Deaths of Cleon and [Brasidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasidas) at Amphipolis (5.1-5.13)

In the tenth year of the war, the Athenian leader Cleon led an expedition to Thrace to recapture Amphipolis from the Spartan general [Brasidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasidas). Seeing the Athenian army in disarray, [Brasidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasidas) launched a surprise attack. In the ensuing **Battle of Amphipolis (422 BC)**, both commanders were killed. The Athenians were decisively defeated. The people of Amphipolis buried [Brasidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasidas) within their city and worshipped him as their new founder.

---
## The Peace of [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias) (5.14-5.24)

The deaths of Cleon and [Brasidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasidas), the primary war hawks on both sides, created momentum for peace. [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens), demoralized by recent defeats, and [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta), desperate to recover the prisoners from Pylos, were both eager for a settlement. Led by [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias) of [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) and King King Pleistoanax of [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta), they negotiated the **Peace of [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias)**, a fifty-year treaty based on returning all conquests.

However, the peace was flawed from the start:
- Key Spartan allies—notably [Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth), Boeotia, Megara, and Elis—refused to ratify it.
- The Spartan commander at Amphipolis, Clearidas, refused to hand the city over to the Athenians, creating an immediate point of contention.

---
## An Unstable Peace and the Argive Alliance (5.25-5.56)

[Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) argues this period was not a true peace but merely an **Unstable Peace** within a single, continuous war.

- **[Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth)'s Defection:** Angry with [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta), [Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth) turned to Argos, a major democratic power that had been neutral.
- **The Quadruple Alliance:** Argos began forming a new democratic coalition, joined by Mantinea and Elis. In [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens), the brilliant and ambitious **[Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades)**, a rival of [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias), championed this movement. By exposing Spartan duplicity, [Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades) skillfully persuaded [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) to abandon its new alliance with [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) and join the Argive coalition.

---
## The Battle of Mantinea (5.57-5.75)

This new alliance led to direct conflict in the Peloponnesus. The Spartan King King Agis mobilized the largest Peloponnesian army in generations. Near Mantinea, the Spartan-led forces confronted the army of Argos, Mantinea, and [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens).

The **Battle of Mantinea (421 BC)** was the largest hoplite battle of the war. Though their left wing was initially broken, the superior discipline of the Spartan center and right, led by King Agis, secured a complete victory. The Argive alliance was shattered, and [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta)'s military prestige, damaged since the disaster at Pylos, was fully restored.

---
## The Melian Dialogue and Conquest of Melos (5.84-5.116)

In the sixteenth year of the war, [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) sent an expedition to the small, neutral island of Melos, a Spartan colony, and demanded its submission. This led to the famous **Melian Dialogue**.

### Athenian Position: Might Makes Right
The Athenians set aside all arguments of justice, stating the core tenet of **Realpolitik**:
> "The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must."

They argued it was in [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens)'s interest to subjugate Melos to demonstrate their power, and in Melos's interest to submit to avoid annihilation.

### Melian Position: Hope and Honor
The Melians refused, appealing to justice, the favor of the gods, and their hope that their Spartan kin would come to their aid out of honor.

The Athenians dismissed their hopes as foolish. When the Melians refused to yield, [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) laid siege to the city. After a blockade of several months, Melos surrendered unconditionally. The Athenians executed all the adult men, sold the women and children into slavery, and colonized the island themselves, an act of utter brutality that became infamous throughout the Greek world.

## The Decision to Invade Sicily (6.1-6.8)

In the sixteenth year of the war, [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) resolved to launch the massive **[Sicilian Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Expedition)**.
> [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) notes that most Athenians were dangerously ignorant of the island's vast size and population, undertaking a war "not much inferior to that against the Peloponnesians".

The formal pretext was an appeal from their ally, Egesta, which was at war with Selinus, an ally of the powerful city of [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily). The Egestans deceptively promised substantial funds to finance the war. The assembly voted to send a fleet under three generals: **[Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias)**, **[Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades)**, and **Lamachus**.

---
## The Great Debate at [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) (6.9-6.26)

At a second assembly, a great debate took place over the wisdom of the expedition.

### [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias)’s Argument Against
[Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias), chosen to command against his will, argued passionately against the enterprise. He warned that [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) was leaving powerful enemies at home, the empire was not yet secure, and Sicily was too large and distant to conquer. He accused [Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades) of seeking personal glory and profit at the state's expense.

### [Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades)’s Argument For
[Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades) countered, defending his right to command and arguing his personal magnificence brought glory to [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens). He portrayed the Sicilian cities as weak and divided, and claimed that **an empire must constantly expand or risk decline**. He asserted that with its powerful navy, [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) could project power in Sicily without significant risk from [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta).

### [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias)’s Gambit
Swayed by [Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades), the assembly was set on war. In a last-ditch effort, [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias) tried to deter them by demanding a massive force of over 100 triremes and 5,000 hoplites. His plan backfired spectacularly; instead of being frightened by the cost, the Athenians "became more eager for it than ever," and voted to give the generals full powers.

---
## Sacrilege and the Departure of the Fleet (6.27-6.52)

As the fleet prepared to sail, a shocking act of sacrilege occurred: the **Mutilation of the Hermae**. This was seen as a terrible omen and part of a conspiracy to overthrow the democracy. The investigation expanded to include accusations of the **Profanation of the Eleusinian Mysteries**, with [Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades) named as a key culprit. His enemies arranged to postpone his trial until after he had departed, fearing his popularity with the army.

The fleet that departed from the Piraeus was "by far the most costly and splendid Hellenic force that had ever been sent out by a single city". Upon arriving at Rhegium, the generals discovered the Egestaean deception—they had only thirty talents`1178`. They debated their next move:
- [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias) advocated a limited demonstration of force.
- [Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades) proposed building a broad coalition before attacking [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily).
- Lamachus argued for an immediate, all-out assault.

[Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades)'s more cautious plan was adopted.

---
## The Recall of [Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades) and First Engagements (6.53-6.105)

While establishing a base at Catana, the state ship arrived to recall [Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades) for trial. Knowing he would be condemned, **[Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades) fled**, eventually making his way to [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) to offer his services to the enemy.

Now under the command of [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias) and Lamachus, the Athenians lured the Syracusan army away and landed unopposed near the Olympieum. In the first major battle, the Athenians were victorious, though the superior Syracusan cavalry prevented an effective pursuit.

Rather than press their advantage, the Athenians withdrew to Catana and Naxos for the winter to await reinforcements. This **strategic delay** gave [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily) crucial time to prepare. They sent envoys to [Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth) and [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) for aid. At [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta), [Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades) revealed [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens)'s ultimate ambitions and persuaded the Spartans to:
1.  Send a Spartan general, **Gylippus**, to lead the Syracusan defense.
2.  Establish a permanent fort at **Decelea** in Attica.

This advice would prove devastating to [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens).

## The Arrival of Gylippus and the Turn of the Tide (7.1-7.8)

The eighteenth year of the war began with the arrival of the Spartan general **Gylippus** in Sicily. [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias), now in sole command after the death of Lamachus, held Gylippus's small force in contempt and failed to stop him from entering [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily) over the Epipolae plateau.

Gylippus's arrival immediately reversed the course of the **Siege of [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily)**. He captured the Athenian fort at Labdalum and began building a **Counter-wall** to cut off the Athenian line of Circumvallation. In a key engagement, Gylippus captured the Athenian forts on the Plemmyrium promontory, a massive strategic blow that made the Athenian naval position in the Great Harbor precarious.

---
## [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias)’s Letter and the Second Athenian Expedition (7.9-7.19)

With his army now effectively the besieged, [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias) sent a desperate letter to [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens). He detailed the arrival of Gylippus, the loss of Plemmyrium, and the crumbling state of his fleet. He concluded that [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) must either recall the expedition or dispatch a second armament of equal size. He also asked to be relieved of command due to a severe kidney disease.

The Athenians refused to relieve [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias) but voted to send a second powerful fleet and army under their most energetic generals, **Demosthenes** and **Eurymedon**.

---
## The Fortification of Decelea and Naval Battles in the Harbor (7.19-7.35)

While the second expedition prepared, [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta), acting on [Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades)'s advice, established a permanent fortified post at **Decelea** in Attica. [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) notes this was a principal cause of [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens)'s eventual ruin, enabling year-round devastation and encouraging the mass desertion of skilled slaves.

In [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily), buoyed by their success, the Syracusans challenged [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) at sea. In a series of naval engagements in the Great Harbor, while not decisively beaten, the Athenians lost their psychological edge as the Syracusans gained experience and confidence.

---
## Demosthenes’ Arrival and the Night Attack on Epipolae (7.36-7.50)

The arrival of Demosthenes with 73 ships and 5,000 hoplites temporarily crushed Syracusan morale. Seeing the dire situation, Demosthenes argued for immediate, bold action and planned a complex **Night Attack on Epipolae** to recapture the plateau.

The attack was a catastrophe. The Athenians initially succeeded but fell into disorder in the darkness and confusion. Panicked by a Boeotian counterattack on unfamiliar terrain, the army was routed. In the chaotic flight down the steep cliffs, men were killed by the enemy, their own comrades, or by falling to their deaths.

---
## The Final Battles and Annihilation of the Athenian Army (7.51-7.87)

After the disaster, Demosthenes argued for an immediate withdrawal. [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias), however, refused, fearing the Athenian assembly and holding a secret hope of betrayal within [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily). This delay proved fatal.

When [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias) finally agreed to retreat, an **eclipse of the moon** occurred. A deeply superstitious man, [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias) insisted on waiting the prescribed 27 days before departing, an example of **Superstition in War** with devastating consequences. The Syracusans seized the opportunity. They attacked by land and sea, defeating the Athenian fleet in the **Final Battle in the Great Harbor** and killing Eurymedon. They then blocked the mouth of the harbor, trapping the entire Athenian armament.

Desperate, the Athenians staked everything on one final breakout attempt, which was completely defeated as the army watched in horror from the shore.

The only option left was the **Athenian Retreat from [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily)** by land. Over 40,000 men began a desperate march, harassed continuously by the enemy. The division led by Demosthenes was surrounded and surrendered. [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias)'s division was trapped at the **Assinarus River**, where, crazed by thirst, the men were slaughtered. [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias) surrendered to Gylippus.

The generals [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias) and Demosthenes were executed. Thousands of Athenian and allied prisoners were sent to die of exposure and starvation in the **Stone Quarries of [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily)**.

> [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) concludes: "they were destroyed, as the saying is, with a total destruction, their fleet, their army—everything was destroyed, and few out of many returned home."
