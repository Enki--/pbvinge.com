# Man, the State, and War

## Online Description

What are the causes of war? Waltz probes the ideas that thinkers throughout the history of Western civilisation - including St. Augustine, Hobbes, Kant, & Spinoza - have offered to explain the reasons for men & related prescriptions for peace.
  

## **🧭 60‑Second Brief**

- **Core claim (1–2 sentences):** Explanations for war cluster at three “images”—**man**, **the state**, and **the international system**—but the anarchical **system** operates as the _permissive_ cause that renders war recurrent unless radically altered (e.g., world government). Thus, first- and second‑image factors are the immediate (efficient) causes of particular wars, while anarchy conditions them.     
    
- **Causal mechanism in a phrase:** **Anarchy → self‑help → security dilemma & balancing → recurrent conflict.**   
    
- **Paradigm & level(s) of analysis:** Classical realism with a three‑level analytic scheme (individual, state, system); third image frames the others. 
    
- **Why it matters for policy/strategy (1–2 bullets):**
    
    - Policies premised solely on improving people or regimes often misfire if they neglect systemic constraints. 
        
    - Even well‑intentioned states must prepare for balancing and deterrence; morality travels differently across domestic vs. anarchical settings. 
        
    

  

## **🧪 Theory Map (IR)**

- **Paradigm(s):** Classical Realism (with proto‑structural insights); engages Liberal and Marxist/revisionist claims as second‑image alternatives.   
    
- **Level(s) of analysis:** **Individual / State / Systemic** (Waltz’s “images”). 
    
- **Unit(s) of analysis:** Individuals (leaders, publics), states (regime type, domestic coalitions), and the state system (distribution of capabilities; absence of authority).   
    
- **Dependent variable(s):** Occurrence/recurrence of war; patterns of peace.
    
- **Key independent variable(s):** Human nature and elite behavior (1st image); regime type, economic/social structure (2nd image); anarchy, relative power/balancing (3rd image).     
    
- **Causal mechanism(s):** Efficient causes (decisions of people and states) + **permissive cause** (anarchy: “wars occur because there is nothing to prevent them”). 
    
- **Scope conditions:** Applies to systems of **multiple sovereign states without a superior coercive authority**; logic weakens if effective world government emerges.   
    
- **Observable implications / predictions:** Persistent balancing and alliance formation; preventive war temptations under “shadow of the future”; public‑opinion “sanctions” insufficient to ensure peace absent coercion.     
    
- **Potential falsifiers / disconfirming evidence:** Durable peace among sovereigns without higher authority; systematic non‑balancing despite rising hegemons; reliable replacement of force by public opinion in interstate conflict.

## **✅ Direct Responses to Course Questions**

  

> Answer each question in order using the text; add page refs where available; append ✓ after each.

  

**Q1. What examples you can think of that lend support to Waltz’ three different images of the causes of war?**

**Answer:**

- **First image (individuals):** Waltz canvasses thinkers who tie conflict to human drives and leadership pathologies (e.g., _animus dominandi_); he recounts proposals to select “mentally fit” leaders to avoid war—illustrating the belief that **leaders’ traits** can precipitate conflict. (pp. 34–36, 79–80)   
    
- **Second image (state structure):** “Have‑not” claims, nationalism, and regime types are invoked to explain aggression; liberal hopes that **democracies + public opinion** will pacify relations exemplify this image. (pp. 83–84, 118–121)   
    
- **Third image (system/anarchy):** **Preventive war incentives** and **balancing** under anarchy (e.g., Thucydides’ logic; alliance dynamics) show how **self‑help** generates recurrent conflict. (pp. 159–161, 229–231)    ✓
    

  

**Q2. What examples can you think of when the United States has pursued any one of these causes to support peace and avoid war?**

**Answer:**

- **Second‑image path:** **Wilson’s** program (“community of power,” reliance on organized public opinion and law) sought peace by **reforming states and rules**, a paradigmatic second‑image prescription. (pp. 118–121) 
    
- **Third‑image path:** Waltz reads post‑war U.S. strategy (e.g., Atlantic/Western defense community debates) as **balancing** against Soviet power—deterrence grounded in anarchy, regardless of the rhetoric. (p. 209)  ✓
    

  

**Q3. How does the US, Russia, and China exert power to achieve their goals in international relations?**

**Answer:** Waltz does not analyze this specific triad, but his framework implies **great powers pursue relative security** through **alliances, armaments, and internal capacity**, because in anarchy “there is no automatic harmony,” and force remains the ultimate arbiter when rules fail. (pp. 160, 207–209, 225–226)    ✓

  

**Q4. Do great powers rely more or less on one “face” of power?**

**Answer:** In Waltz’s terms, **coercive capacity** looms largest for great powers under anarchy; non‑coercive faces (agenda‑setting, persuasion) cannot reliably substitute for credible force when survival is at stake. Moral expectations calibrated to domestic order **do not map cleanly** onto international politics. (pp. 207–209)  ✓

  

**Q5. Do medium and small powers use different “faces” of power?**

**Answer:** Yes—because **survival under anarchy** pushes weaker states toward **coalitions and balancing** rather than unilateral coercion; “momentarily disadvantaged [states] combine and recombine” to prevent dominance. (pp. 207–209)  ✓

  

**Q6. Is it possible to use Lukes’ third face of power to shape others’ worldviews?**

**Answer:** Waltz treats **public opinion** and ideas as instruments often emphasized by liberals (e.g., Bentham/Wilson), but he is skeptical they can _by themselves_ secure peace across states; still, **elites can mobilize publics**, indicating worldview‑shaping is feasible though limited by structure. (pp. 79, 102, 118–121)    ✓

  

**Q7. Can the third face of power be used, strategically, to ferment division and stoke conflict?**

**Answer:** **Yes.** Because mobilized opinion and elite persuasion can channel passions and fears, they can worsen the **security dilemma** rather than relieve it. Waltz explicitly warns against overconfidence in behavioral manipulation as a route to peace. (pp. 79–80, 159–161)    ✓

  

**Q8. Can it be used to find common ground among actors and strengthen peaceful relations?**

**Answer:** **Sometimes**, but only **conditionally**: where structural incentives align, opinion can lubricate cooperation; absent that, reliance on opinion alone is **utopian**. (pp. 118–121)  ✓

  

**Q9. Is the exertion of power ethical?**

**Answer:** Waltz argues that in international anarchy **moral judgments shift with the security context**; “power politics” is neither inherently moral nor immoral—it can be a **reasoned response** to conditions. (p. 208; cf. conclusion pp. 237–238)    ✓

  

**Q10. Does it matter how power is exerted in the international arena or what the envisioned ends of the use of power are?**

**Answer:** **Yes.** Means and ends must be evaluated against systemic constraints; force may be necessary to uphold order, but **ends‑oriented claims** (e.g., moral projects) cannot suspend the **balancing logic** without changing the system itself. (pp. 207–209, 237–238)    ✓

  

## **📚 Section-by-Section Notes**

  

> Cover every assigned chapter/section in order.

  

### **Chapter I: Introduction (pp. 1–15)**

- **Purpose:** Frame the central question—**where are the major causes of war?**—and sort answers into **three images**: man, the state, the state system. 
    
- **Key claims:** Each image admits internal diversity; prescriptions must match the locus of cause; logics can be _optimistic_ or _pessimistic_ within the same image. 
    
- **Implications:** Analytic clarity is needed to avoid mixing prescriptions with mismatched causes. 
    

  

### **Chapter II: The First Image—International Conflict and Human Behavior (pp. 16–41)**

- **Purpose:** Explain war via **human nature, passions, and reason**.
    
- **Key claims:** Realists often stress _persistent defects_ in human nature (e.g., Niebuhr, Morgenthau); yet conflict can also arise from competition without invoking innate evil. (pp. 34–36, 44–45)   
    
- **Evidence/examples:** Morgenthau’s dual roots (competition vs. animus dominandi). (pp. 35–36) 
    
- **Implications:** First‑image pessimism overstates what it can explain; basic causes are least manipulable. (p. 34) 
    

  

### **Chapter III: Some Implications of the First Image—The Behavioral Sciences and the Reduction of Interstate Tension (pp. 42–79)**

- **Purpose:** Assess **behavioralist** remedies (leadership selection, mass attitude change).
    
- **Key claims:** Useful at the margin but **insufficient** without political analysis; elites can mobilize publics, but psychology alone cannot solve political problems. (pp. 79–98; esp. 79)   
    
- **Implications:** Overreliance on first‑image fixes risks misdiagnosis. (pp. 96–98) 
    

  

### **Chapter IV: The Second Image—International Conflict and the Internal Structure of States (pp. 80–123)**

- **Purpose:** Shift focus to **domestic structures** as explanations for war/peace.
    
- **Key claims:** “Defects” in states (e.g., expansionist doctrines, have‑not claims) can spur war; liberals expect **democracy + public opinion** to pacify relations. (pp. 83–84, 100–102, 118–121)   
    
- **Implications:** Reforms may reduce conflict, but reliance on opinion or contracts alone is **hopeless** absent enforcement. (p. 119) 
    

  

### **Chapter V: Some Implications of the Second Image—International Socialism and the Coming of the First World War (pp. 124–158)**

- **Purpose:** Test socialist (second‑image) claims against 1914.
    
- **Key claims:** **Revisionist optimism** underestimated systemic pressures; appeals to class solidarity failed under **state** imperatives. (p. 158) 
    
- **Implications:** Second‑image analyses require **third‑image** context. (pp. 157–158) 
    

  

### **Chapter VI: The Third Image—International Conflict and International Anarchy (pp. 159–186)**

- **Purpose:** Develop the **anarchy** argument (Rousseau, Thucydides).
    
- **Key claims:** “**In anarchy there is no automatic harmony**”; states must rely on **self‑help**; preventive war incentives arise from uncertainty and relative gains concerns. (pp. 160–161) 
    
- **Implications:** Third image explains **recurrence** of war, not any single war. (pp. 186, 232)   
    

  

### **Chapter VII: Some Implications of the Third Image—Examples from Economics, Politics, and History (pp. 187–223)**

- **Purpose:** Illustrate balancing and prudence via cases (Thucydides, European diplomacy).
    
- **Key claims:** Balance is often **imposed by events on statesmen**; coalitions form to block ascendancy; moral codes operate differently without a sovereign. (pp. 207–209, 229–231)   
    
- **Implications:** Even anti‑balance rhetoric tends to **converge on balancing behavior** when threat rises. (p. 209) 
    

  

### **Chapter VIII: Conclusion (pp. 224–238)**

- **Purpose:** Integrate images; address prescriptions.
    
- **Key claims:** **World government** is the logical cure but **unattainable in practice**; third image provides the framework, first and second supply the forces; **permissive vs. efficient causes** distinguished. (pp. 232–238)   
    
- **Implications:** Foreign policy grounded in the third image is **neither moral nor immoral**; prudence requires attention to systemic constraints. (p. 238) 
    

  

## **🧩 Key Concepts & Definitions (author’s usage)**

- **Image:** A conceptual “picture” that locates primary causes **within man, the state, or the state system**; each yields different diagnoses and prescriptions. (pp. 12–14) 
    
- **Permissive cause:** Systemic anarchy that **allows** wars to occur—“wars occur because there is nothing to prevent them.” (p. 232) 
    
- **Efficient (immediate) causes:** Concrete acts of **individuals or states** precipitating a given war. (pp. 232–233) 
    
- **Security dilemma / balancing:** Under self‑help, states pursue relative security, generating **counter‑moves and coalitions**. (pp. 207–209, 229–231)   
    
- **Public opinion as sanction:** Liberal reliance on publicity and opinion to discipline states—treated as **insufficient** without enforcement. (pp. 102, 118–121) 
    

  

## **🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Actors & Perspectives**

- **Individuals/leaders** — passions, misperception, moral claims; can trigger crises but are constrained by structure. (pp. 34–36, 232–233)   
    
- **States/regimes** — domestic arrangements (liberal, socialist, nationalist) shape preferences and capacity. (pp. 83–84, 118–121, 124–158)     
    
- **System of states** — anarchy + distribution of capabilities set the **rules of the game** that condition all actors. (pp. 159–161, 207–209)   
    

  

## **🕰 Timeline of Major Events (if toggled = Yes)**

  

_Not included (toggle = No)._

  

## **🧠 Policy & Strategy Takeaways**

- **Anchor ideals to structure:** Promote democracy, opinion, and law **with** credible enforcement and alliance design; otherwise expect disappointment. (pp. 118–121, 207–209)   
    
- **Plan for balancing dynamics:** Assume others will react; build coalitions, maintain readiness, manage fears that drive preventive temptations. (pp. 229–231) 
    
- **Moral prudence:** In anarchy, ethics and survival are entangled; judge means/ends **in light of** systemic constraints. (pp. 207–209, 237–238)   
    

  

## **⚔️ Comparative Placement in the IR Canon**

- **Closest kin / contrasts:** Third‑image analysis resonates with **Rousseau/Thucydides** and Realpolitik; contrasts with **liberal** and **socialist** second‑image optimism. (pp. 159–161, 118–121, 124–158)     
    
- **Distinctive move:** Separates **permissive** from **efficient** causes, preventing single‑cause fallacies. (pp. 232–233) 
    
- **Where it sits:** Classical realism with a proto‑structural core that Waltz later develops more formally. (pp. 12–14; 207–209)   
    

  

## **🧐 Critical Reflections**

- **Strengths:** Clear analytic sorting; powerful account of **recurrence**; rigorous linkage of policy prescriptions to causal claims. (pp. 12–14, 232–238)   
    
- **Weaknesses / blind spots:** Abstract on **how** domestic politics filters systemic pressures; skepticism toward social power/opinion may underplay non‑coercive tools under some conditions. (pp. 118–121) 
    
- **What would change the conclusion:** Sustained empirical peace among sovereigns without higher authority; robust evidence that opinion/law displace force system‑wide. (pp. 207–209, 237–238)   
    

  

## **❓ Open Questions for Seminar**

- How should policymakers **sequence** first‑/second‑image reforms under third‑image constraints? (pp. 232–233) 
    
- When (if ever) do **relative gains** concerns relax enough to permit reliance on opinion/law? (pp. 160–161, 207–209)

## **📝 Exam Drills (if toggled = Yes)**

- **Likely prompt:** “State and evaluate Waltz’s three images. Which best explains war, and what follows for policy?”
    
    **Skeleton answer:**
    
    1. **Define images** (man/state/system) and link to **prescriptions**. (pp. 12–14) 
        
    2. **Argue third image** as _permissive_ cause; show how first/second supply **efficient** causes (with examples). (pp. 232–233; 159–161; 118–121)     
        
    3. **Policy**: Combine internal reform and persuasion **with** balancing/deterrence; avoid single‑cause strategies. (pp. 207–209, 237–238)
