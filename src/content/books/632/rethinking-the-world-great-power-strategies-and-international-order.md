# Rethinking the World

## Online Description

Stunning shifts in the worldviews of states mark the modern history of international affairs: how do societies think about—and rethink—international order and security? Japan's "opening," German conquest, American internationalism, Maoist independence, and Gorbachev's "new thinking" molded international conflict and cooperation in their eras. How do we explain such momentous changes in foreign policy—and in other cases their equally surprising absence? The nature of strategic ideas, Jeffrey W. Legro argues, played a critical and overlooked role in these transformations. Big changes in foreign policies are rare because it is difficult for individuals to overcome the inertia of entrenched national mentalities. Doing so depends on a particular nexus of policy expectations, national experience, and ready replacement ideas. In a sweeping comparative history, Legro explores the sources of strategy in the United States and Germany before and after the world wars, in Tokugawa Japan, and in the Soviet Union. He charts the likely future of American primacy and a rising China in the coming century. Rethinking the World tells us when and why we can expect changes in the way states think about the world, why some ideas win out over others, and why some leaders succeed while others fail in redirecting grand strategy.
  
## **🧭 60‑Second Brief**

- **Core claim (1–2 sentences):** Major foreign policy shifts by great powers occur through a **two‑stage ideational process**—**collapse** of a dominant orthodoxy when outcomes starkly violate social expectations, followed by **consolidation** of a viable replacement idea that demonstrates early efficacy. Ideas are irreducible causal forces but interact regularly with power and domestic interests.   
    
- **Causal mechanism in a phrase:** _Expectations–results mismatch → delegitimation → focal alternative + perceived success → institutionalization._ 
    
- **Paradigm & level(s) of analysis:** Synthetic (constructivist core + realist and liberal inputs); primarily **state/collective** level with systemic and individual interactions.   
    
- **Why it matters for policy/strategy (1–2 bullets):**
    
    - Anticipating change requires tracking **collective expectations** and the **supply/efficacy of alternatives**, not just shocks or power shifts.   
        
    - External actors can **shape consolidation** by enabling early “successes” for preferred ideas (e.g., post‑1945 U.S. support for West German integration). 
        
    

  

## **🧪 Theory Map (IR)**

- **Paradigm(s):** Constructivist core; “rough synthesis” with realism (constraints of power) and liberalism (interest groups, leaders, institutions). 
    
- **Level(s) of analysis:** **State/collective** (dominant national ideas); with **systemic** feedback (power, transnational influence) and **individual** agency operating within ideational constraints.   
    
- **Unit(s) of analysis:** National **orthodoxies** about how to relate to international society: **integrationist, separatist, revisionist**.   
    
- **Dependent variable(s):** Continuity or **change in a state’s foreign policy orientation** toward international society. 
    
- **Key independent variable(s):** (1) **Expectations–results gap** from events; (2) **number/salience of replacement ideas**; (3) **perceived efficacy** of the alternative; (4) **embeddedness** of old orthodoxy; (5) **transnational support/opposition**.       
    
- **Causal mechanism(s):** **Two‑stage** process: **collapse** (delegitimation via violated expectations and undesirable consequences) → **consolidation** (coordination on a focal alternative that appears to “work” and becomes institutionalized).   
    
- **Scope conditions:** Most applicable to **great powers**; periods with **interpretable feedback**; when **collective ideas** (not just leader beliefs) structure policy; outcomes contingent on **availability of alternatives** and **power‑enabled results**.   
    
- **Observable implications / predictions:**
    
    - No durable change after shocks if **no prominent alternative** or **mixed alternatives** → “Try harder!” or “Counterrevolution.” 
        
    - Rapid consolidation when **single alternative** exists and early **positive results** follow → “Long live change!” 
        
    - External patrons can **tilt consolidation** by underwriting early success. 
        
    
- **Potential falsifiers / disconfirming evidence:**
    
    - Enduring change **without** prior collapse/efficacy;
        
    - Sharp **collapse** **with** salient alternative yet **no change** (beyond anomalies discussed);
        
    - Cases where **power or interests alone** predict timing/direction better than the expectations–results logic.

## **✅ Direct Responses to Course Questions**

  

**Q1. How do ideas about international politics and foreign policy emerge and take hold?**

**Answer:** They are **collective**, socially salient ideas that crystallize as **orthodoxies** through institutions, symbols, and practices; not merely aggregated individual opinions. They arise from prior ideas, become embedded in **“collective memories,” government procedures, educational systems, and the rhetoric of statecraft**, and are contested by subgroups even while dominant. (pp. 2–7, 24–27)  ✓

  

**Q2. When do these ideas change and when do they remain consistent?**

**Answer:** Change requires a **two‑stage** sequence: **collapse** when outcomes contradict expectations generated by the orthodoxy; **consolidation** when a **prominent alternative** demonstrates **early efficacy** and becomes institutionalized. Continuity persists when shocks **fit expectations**, consequences are tolerable, the old orthodoxy is **deeply embedded**, or when there is **no/too many alternatives**—yielding **“Try harder!”** or **“Counterrevolution”** paths. (pp. 28–37, 178–180)      ✓

  

**Q3. What is the relationship between a change in ideas and a change in the international system?**

**Answer:** Great‑power ideational shifts **help constitute** international politics; national trajectories can **reconfigure** order (e.g., post‑1945 U.S. integrationism) or leave it intact when change fails to consolidate. Future order thus depends on **interplay of ideas and events** across major states (Legro highlights U.S. and China). (pp. 177–187)    ✓

  

**Q4. What is the relationship between power and ideas?**

**Answer:** Ideas are **irreducible** but interact with power in **regular ways**: power shapes **consequences** (making some ideas “work”), and powerful states can **enable** or **impede** consolidation abroad; yet power alone cannot predict shifts (e.g., U.S. power after WWI without integrationist consolidation). (pp. 178, 181–182)    ✓

  

**Q5. How do ideas function at the individual level versus at the group level?**

**Answer:** Individual psychology explains **micro‑change**, but Legro emphasizes **collective ideas** that are **intersubjective** and often institutionalized; they **constrain** and **enable** leaders. National ideas are not mere sums of individuals; they possess **organizational** properties with coordination problems in both collapse and consolidation. (pp. 2–7, 14–16)    ✓

  

**Q6. Can you connect Legro’s explanations to Waltz first and second “images”?**

**Answer:** Legro’s account primarily sits at Waltz’s **second image** (national ideas embedded in state societies), while acknowledging **first‑image** leaders operating within ideational constraints and **third‑image** (systemic) feedback via power and transnational influence. (pp. 2–7, 178–182)    ✓

  

**Q7. What causal mechanisms would you incorporate to improve Legro’s framework?**

**Answer:** Building on his mechanisms, add (i) **intra‑elite network diffusion** to specify how focal alternatives gain coherence; (ii) **rhetorical entrapment** to track how opponents’ language is leveraged during consolidation; and (iii) **sequencing of “success signals”** (early material wins, audience costs avoided) to operationalize “efficacy.” These extend Legro’s own notes on **collective ideation hurdles** and **efficacy‑driven institutionalization**. (pp. 31–37, 178–180)    ✓

  

**Q8. How does this reading help you anticipate the creation of new ideas or collapse of existing ones?**

**Answer:** Monitor: (1) **expectations** publicly articulated by leaders/orthodoxies; (2) **outcome sequences** that visibly contradict them; (3) the **menu of alternatives** in circulation; and (4) **early “wins”** for any challenger. Where one alternative exists and early results correlate with its prescriptions, expect rapid **consolidation**; otherwise expect **retrenchment**. (pp. 28–37, 178–187)    ✓

  

## **📚 Section-by-Section Notes**

  

> Cover every assigned chapter/section in order. (Contents: Ch.1–6; Appx.1–2) 

  

### **Chapter 1: Great Power Ideas and Change (pp. 1–23)**

- **Purpose:** Frame the puzzle—why dramatic ideational shifts occur (or not) in great powers; define the **integrationist–separatist–revisionist** typology. 
    
- **Key claims:** National ideas are **collective**, embedded, and **constitutive** of behavior; we need a framework for **change** in such ideas. 
    
- **Evidence/examples:** Typological illustrations (Tokugawa Japan, Napoleonic France, Nazi Germany, U.S. pre‑WWII). 
    
- **Implications:** Studying **national orientations toward international society** is distinct from studying specific strategies (e.g., containment). 
    
- **Ties to course theme:** Puts **ideas** (not only power/interests) at the center of big foreign policy moves.
    

  

### **Chapter 2: Explaining Change and Continuity (pp. 24–48)**

- **Purpose:** Present the **two‑stage model** with explicit consolidation scenarios (B1–B3).   
    
- **Key claims:** **Collapse** hinges on **expectations–results** gaps; **consolidation** hinges on **availability** and **efficacy** of **replacement ideas**.   
    
- **Evidence/examples:** U.S. after WWI (continuity despite “shock”); Weimar Germany (defeat without ideational shift); binary vs. fragmented oppositions. 
    
- **Implications:** Shocks alone are **insufficient**; watch **idea–event** interactions.
    

  

### **Chapter 3: The Ebb and Flow of American Internationalism (pp. 49–83)**

- **Purpose:** Trace U.S. movement from **no‑entanglement** to **integrationism**; test alt. explanations.
    
- **Key claims:** Continuity after WWI; decisive change during/after WWII; the shift **preceded** the Cold War.   
    
- **Evidence/examples:** Content analysis of **State of the Union** (1908–1950) + editorial responses (Figure 3.1; method in Appx.2).     
    
- **Implications:** Ideational consolidation can be **observed in discourse**; public symbols track collective orientation.
    

  

### **Chapter 4: Germany, from Outsider to Insider (pp. 84–121)**

- **Purpose:** Explain Germany’s post‑1918 **continuity** vs. post‑1945 **integration**.
    
- **Key claims:** WWI defeat produced **collapse conditions**, but **Versailles** blocked **consolidation**, yielding a **“Try harder!”** revanchist path; after 1945, **total defeat + Allied support** enabled **integrationist consolidation**.   
    
- **Evidence/examples:** Interwar doctrines (“war as ultimate arbiter”); Berlin airlift, Occupation Statute, NATO entry as **efficacy** signals. (pp. 86, 113–121)   
    
- **Implications:** External power can **sponsor** consolidation of new orthodoxies.
    

  

### **Chapter 5: Overhaul of Orthodoxy in Tokugawa Japan and the Soviet Union (pp. 122–160)**

- **Purpose:** Two non‑world‑war cases to probe generality.
    
- **Key claims:** Tokugawa **seclusion orthodoxy** lacked a domestic alternative in 1853, delaying change; Meiji consolidation required new ideas + early success. Soviet **“new thinking”** consolidated as **correlation‑of‑forces** expectations failed and a plausible **mutual security** idea had networks in place.     
    
- **Evidence/examples:** Daimyo opinion split; Gorbachev’s 1986 agenda; transnational epistemic ties. (pp. 126–141, 142–157)   
    
- **Implications:** **Supply of alternatives** (and their social carriers) is pivotal.
    

  

### **Chapter 6: The Next Century (pp. 161–188)**

- **Purpose:** Synthesize findings; explore **U.S. “Bush revolution”** and **China’s rise**.
    
- **Key claims:** Absent further shocks and spectacular efficacy, U.S. likely to **tack back** to Atlantic‑Pact integrationism; China’s trajectory shows **cautious integrationism**, though negative feedback or crises could spur **separatist** or revisionist turns. (pp. 165–174)     
    
- **Implications:** Policy debates (engagement vs. containment) should be keyed to **China’s internal ideational debates and expectations**. 
    

  

### **Appendix 1: The Transformation of Economic Ideas (pp. 189–198)**

- **Purpose:** Test portability to economic policy.
    
- **Key claims:** The same **collapse–consolidation** logic explains **Keynesian turns**, trade shifts, and **monetarist** adoption; in politics, **correlation often speaks louder than causation**. (pp. 190–196)     
    
- **Illustrations:** U.S. tariffs → RTAA reversal; British monetarism post‑1979; EMS success vs. “snake” failure. (pp. 209–213)   
    

  

### **Appendix 2: Analysis of Presidential Discourse (pp. 199–200+)**

- **Purpose:** Coding scheme for Figure 3.1 (0–5 scale; intercoder reliability; newspaper editorial overlay).   
    

  

## **🧩 Key Concepts & Definitions (author’s usage)**

- **Collective (national) ideas:** Intersubjective orthodoxies embedded in institutions, symbols, and routines that guide foreign policy. 
    
- **Integrationism / Separatism / Revisionism:** Ideal‑type orientations toward **joining**, **remaining aloof from**, or **overturning** international society. 
    
- **Collapse:** Delegitimation of the dominant orthodoxy via **expectations–results** contradictions with undesirable consequences. 
    
- **Consolidation:** Coordination on a **prominent alternative** that shows **efficacy**, leading to institutionalization. 
    
- **Collective ideation hurdles:** Coordination and assurance problems that impede both stages. 
    

  

## **🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Actors & Perspectives**

- **Leaders (e.g., Wilson, Gorbachev, Meiji elites, Adenauer)** — act **within** collective ideas; success hinges on exploiting **collapse–consolidation** windows and early results.   
    
- **Domestic coalitions/interest groups** — supply and sponsor **replacement ideas**; their distribution affects consolidation. 
    
- **External powers/transnational networks** — can **catalyze collapse** (by generating unfavorable consequences) and **fund/validate** consolidation. 
    

  

## **🕰 Timeline of Major Events**

- **1640–1868** — Tokugawa **seclusion** orthodoxy; opening pressures mount (1853 Perry). Significance: absence of domestic alternatives delays consolidation.   
    
- **1868** — **Meiji Restoration**; consolidation of pro‑integration ideas follows initial foreign missions and successes. 
    
- **1908–1950** — U.S. discourse shifts from **aloofness** to **integrationism** during/after WWII (Figure 3.1). 
    
- **1919–1930s** — Germany’s **post‑Versailles** “Try harder!” dynamic; continuity of revisionism. 
    
- **1948–1955** — Berlin airlift; Occupation Statute; FRG entry into NATO—early efficacy and institutional embedding of integration. 
    
- **1985–1986** — **Gorbachev** and **“new thinking”** articulate mutual security; prior expectations fail. 
    

  

## **🧠 Policy & Strategy Takeaways**

- **Implications for today’s policy choices:**
    
    - To **promote change abroad**, **engineer early wins** for preferred alternatives (resources, security guarantees, institutional access). 
        
    - To **anticipate retrenchment**, track when shocks **confirm** rather than violate expectations—there, continuity is likely. 
        
    
- **R/B/C:**
    
    - **Risks:** Backing an alternative without delivering early success may trigger **counterrevolution**. 
        
    - **Benefits:** Well‑timed support can **lock in** integrationist trajectories (e.g., post‑1945 Germany). 
        
    - **Conditions:** Presence of a **single salient alternative**, **credible efficacy**, and **manageable embeddedness** of the old idea. 
        
    
- **If this logic is right, a policymaker should…** invest in **coalition‑building** around one focal idea and **sequence** visible performances that map to its promises.
    

  

## **⚔️ Comparative Placement in the IR Canon**

- **Closest kin / contrasts:** Aligns with **constructivist** emphases on norms/ideas; **qualifies** realist and liberal claims by specifying **when** power/interests bite. 
    
- **How it differs:** Unlike “shocks cause change” or pure **power‑transition** accounts, Legro insists shocks translate through **expectations** and **collective ideation**; unlike purely domestic coalition stories, he specifies **collapse–consolidation** conditions. 
    
- **Placement:** A **synthetic framework** for ideational change, not a single‑paradigm theory. 
    

  

## **🧐 Critical Reflections**

- **Strengths:** Clear **microfoundations** for ideational change; portable beyond security (**Appendix 1**); transparent **observable implications**. 
    
- **Weaknesses / blind spots:** Acknowledged **anomalies** (e.g., interwar Germany rhetoric manipulation; durable Russian integrationism in 1990s despite weak efficacy); small‑N scope. (pp. 181–182) 
    
- **What would change your mind (author’s or yours)?** Multiple cases of durable consolidation **without** early success, or repeated collapses **with** prominent alternatives that nonetheless never change orientations.
    

  

## **❓ Open Questions for Seminar**

- How do we **measure** “expectations” independently of outcomes to avoid ex post coding? (Appx.2 offers one discourse‑based approach.) 
    
- Can **international institutions** themselves become the **carriers** of replacement ideas across states, reducing domestic coordination hurdles?
    

  

## **✍️ Notable Quotes (with pages)**

- “**Ideas are not so much mental as symbolic and organizational;** they are embedded not only in human brains but also in the ‘collective memories,’ government procedures, educational systems, and the rhetoric of statecraft.” (pp. 5–6) 
    
- “Ideational change… **consist[s] of two stages: collapse and consolidation.**” (p. 178) 
    
- “**Shocks are only a potential occasion for change depending on preexisting expectations.**” (pp. 14–15) 
    
- “States will often adopt policies that **correlate** with desired results even when there is no clear evidence that those policies **caused** those results.” (p. 206) 
    
- “The United States shift **preceded—and hence was not caused by—the cold war**.” (p. 72) 
    

  

## **📝 Exam Drills**

- **Likely prompt:** “Explain Legro’s two‑stage model and apply it to one success and one failure of ideational change.”
    
    **Skeleton answer:**
    
    1. **Define framework**—collapse (expectations–results), consolidation (alternative + efficacy). Cite Ch.2. 
        
    2. **Success case:** U.S. WWII → **integrationism** (discourse shift + institutionalization). 
        
    3. **Failure case:** Germany post‑WWI → **“Try harder!”** due to Versailles‑blocked consolidation. 
        
    
- **Likely prompt:** “How should U.S. policy approach a rising China per Legro’s logic?”
    
    **Skeleton answer:**
    
    1. Diagnose **Chinese expectations** & **dominant orientation** (integrationist trend). 
        
    2. **Enable efficacy** for integrationist actors; avoid actions that **validate separatist narratives**. 
        
    3. Monitor **shock–expectation** mismatches that could flip orientations.
