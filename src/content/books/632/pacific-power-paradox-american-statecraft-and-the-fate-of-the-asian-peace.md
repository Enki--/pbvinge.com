# Pacific Power Paradox

## Online Description

A new history of Asian peace since 1979 that considers America’s paradoxical role After more than a century of recurring conflict, the countries of the Asia-Pacific region have managed something remarkable: avoiding war among nations. Since 1979, Asia has endured threats, near-miss crises, and nuclear proliferation but no interstate war. How fragile is this “Asian peace,” and what is America’s role in it? Van Jackson argues that because Washington takes for granted that the United States is a force for good, successive presidencies have failed to see how their statecraft impedes more durable forms of security and inadvertently embrittles peace. At times, the United States has been the region’s bulwark against instability, but America has been a threat to Asian peace as much as it has been its guarantor. By grappling with how America fits into the Asian story, Jackson shows how regional stability has diminished because of U.S. choices, and why America’s margin for geopolitical error is less now than ever before.
  

## **🔫 Author Background**

- Van Jackson is an international-relations scholar focused on Asian security and U.S. statecraft; this book synthesizes scholarly debates and practitioner insights to reassess how U.S. policy shaped the “Asian peace.” _Specific institutional affiliations and degrees_: Not found in provided source.
    
- Related works cited in the book include _Rival Reputations: Coercion and Credibility in US–North Korea Relations_ (Cambridge University Press, 2016), and articles on U.S. primacy and Asian strategy, indicating longstanding expertise on coercion, alliances, and East Asian security. 
    
- The preface notes his Washington experience and the realization, during and after the Trump years, that many “continuities” in U.S. statecraft had been mythologized as benevolent leadership, prompting this reassessment. 
    

  

## **🔍 Author’s Main Issue / Thesis**

  

Jackson argues that the United States has shown **three faces** to the Asian peace—**aloof hegemon**, **vital bulwark**, and **imperious superpower**—often simultaneously. Sustaining peace requires replacing triumphalist “Pacific power” narratives with a **more accurate, layered account** of what actually stabilized Asia since 1979. That layered account identifies six drivers of peace (forward U.S. presence, alliances, great‑power détente, economic interdependence, regionalism, and democracy/good governance) and evaluates each presidency by how it **balanced risk and wagers** relative to these drivers. “A Pacific power narrative more faithful to reality is a prerequisite for better statecraft” (p. 7). 

  

## **🧭 One-Paragraph Overview**

  

_Pacific Power Paradox_ reframes post‑1979 Asian stability as a **contingent, multi‑cause achievement** rather than the straightforward product of U.S. hegemony. Jackson shows how presidents from Nixon to Trump alternately reinforced or eroded peace’s foundations as they pursued other priorities—opening to China, military superiority, unipolar hubris, the war on terror, the Obama pivot, and Trump’s rivalry‑first approach. His analytic lens—the **risk–wager balance**—assesses whether policy choices **jeopardized** (risk) or **positively invested in** (wager) the peace’s known causes. The book ends with **principles** for preserving peace amid Sino‑U.S. rivalry and the rise of “Indo‑Pacific” thinking, urging policy makers to recover the **Asian peace as a referent narrative** for strategy.

  

## **🔑 Top Takeaways**

- **Peace had many parents**: six reinforcing causes—not just U.S. primacy—underwrote Asia’s “relative peace” since 1979. Over‑crediting any single cause invites policy errors. 
    
- **Risk–wager balance** is a powerful diagnostic: presidencies differ by how they accept risks against known peace drivers and where they place positive bets. 
    
- **Détente mattered more than appreciated**: Sino‑U.S. cooperation checked adventurism, reduced miscalculation, and enabled growth—its erosion under Obama and collapse under Trump raised war risks. 
    
- **Unipolar “oxygen” helped—but often by accident**: U.S. presence, alliances, and predictable continuity stabilized Asia, even when Washington pursued other agendas. 
    
- **Rivalry is not a strategy**: overmilitarized, zero‑sum approaches narrow options, embrittle peace, and generate ugly externalities at home and abroad. 
    
- **Indo‑Pacific turn**: offers opportunities (westward extension of stabilizing practices) but risks distraction and overextension; contributions should avoid new entrapments and prioritize anti‑hegemonic balance.
    

  

## **📒 Sections**

  

### **Preface**

  

**Summary:** Jackson recounts that the “East Asian peace” puzzle long went unacknowledged in Washington, where elites credited U.S. hegemony and mythologized benevolence. The Trump era seemed discontinuous at first, but archival and documentary review convinced Jackson it **amplified longstanding habits** in U.S. statecraft. This mythologizing allowed U.S. policy makers to “play with Asia’s fate” without grasping how actions interacted with peace’s layered causes. The book aims to bridge scholarly knowledge about peace’s sources with practitioner narratives that often ignored them. (pp. vii–viii). 

**Key Points:**

- Washington rarely treated absence of war as an object of strategy. 
    
- Trump’s “rupture” masked continuities stretching back decades. 
    
- Need to integrate academic insights on peace into policy narratives. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Reframing narratives; continuity vs. change; demystifying hegemony.
    

  

### **Introduction**

  

**Summary:** The book introduces the **Pacific power paradox** and advances a **layered** account of the Asian peace. Jackson previews the historical chapters (Nixon through Trump) and sets up the six drivers of stability to be used as a diagnostic baseline. The introduction insists that better strategy starts with a more **accurate narrative** about America’s mixed legacy—neither villainizing nor exceptionalist. It outlines the plan to evaluate each presidency’s **risks** (what they imperil in peace’s causes) and **wagers** (what they invest in). It establishes the objective: recover the Asian peace as a **policy heuristic** for future statecraft. (pp. 7–9, 22–23).

**Key Points:**

- Peace is **relative**, exclusion of the Indian subcontinent clarifies the puzzle. 
    
- Three American “faces” toward peace: aloof hegemon, bulwark, imperious superpower. 
    
- Chapters will judge presidencies by risks/wagers against six drivers. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Measurement of peace; narrative discipline; methodology as statecraft guide.

### **Chapter 1: The Asian Peace as a Guide to Statecraft**

  

**Summary:** Jackson defines the **Asian peace** as the post‑1979 absence of interstate war across East Asia and the Pacific and surveys measurement debates (casualty thresholds, structural vs. literal violence). He reviews explanations—power‑based (U.S. presence & alliances), economic interdependence, regional institutions, and localized norms—and argues their **mutual reinforcement** produced stability. The chapter rejects “single‑cause” thinking, advancing a **layered peace** logic culminating in six diagnostic indicators: U.S. forward presence, U.S. alliances, great‑power détente, interdependence, regionalism, and democracy/good governance. He then introduces the **risk–wager balance** as an evaluative tool for presidential choices. (pp. 10, 20–27).

**Key Points:**

- Definitional/measurement issues: relative vs. absolute peace. 
    
- Institutions and norms matter **in combination**, not isolation. 
    
- Six indicators specify peace’s **causal architecture**. 
    
- **Risk–wager**: decisions either undercut (risk) or invest (wager) in these drivers. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Method over monism; theory‑to‑practice translation; caution against over‑crediting hegemony.
    

  

#### **Section 1.1: What Is the Asian Peace?**

  

**Summary:** Establishes a conservative definitional threshold for war (casualty‑based) and justifies excluding the Indian subcontinent (Kargil, Siachen, Kashmir) to preserve analytic clarity. Peace has been **relative** and unevenly just, raising questions about how to count “structural violence.” (p. 10). 

**Key Points:**

- Counting war via casualties reflects de facto conflict reality. 
    
- “Asia” in this book = East Asia + Pacific (not the Indian subcontinent). 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Measurement shapes policy debates; scope conditions matter.
    

  

#### **Section 1.2: Norms, Institutions, Interdependence**

  

**Summary:** Reviews ASEAN’s noninterference/consensus norms and **informal diplomacy** (Track 1.5/2), arguing they reduce audience costs and facilitate de‑escalation. However, “pure culturalist” explanations cannot explain temporal variance or pre‑peace violence. Institutions’ effects are **conditional** on power and interdependence. (pp. 20–21). 

**Key Points:**

- ASEAN norms socialize behavior; outsiders adapt to “act locally.” 
    
- Culture alone cannot explain war/peace variation. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Constructivism with constraints; embeddedness of norms in power/economy.
    

  

#### **Section 1.3: A Layered Peace**

  

**Summary:** Argues explicitly against “method of the single cause” (Morgenthau), emphasizing **complementarity** of U.S. power, interdependence, regionalism, and local norms. Forward U.S. presence is a **prior condition** enabling deeper forms of peace (e.g., ASEAN). (p. 25). 

**Key Points:**

- Multiple mechanisms operate together; relative weights vary over time. 
    
- U.S. presence underwrites space for economic/regional cooperation. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Eclectic theorizing; interdependence of causes.
    

  

#### **Section 1.4: The Risk–Wager Balance**

  

**Summary:** Defines **risk** as choices that imperil the “reference narrative” (the Asian peace) by neglecting a known cause; **wagers** are positive investments aligned with expected stabilizing effects. This two‑concept grammar structures the book’s historical assessments. (pp. 26–27). 

**Key Points:**

- Six indicators become **reference points** for diagnosing risk. 
    
- Wagers without offsetting risks are preferable; risky choices demand compensating wagers. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Decision‑making under uncertainty; analytical discipline.

### **Chapter 2: Founding the Asian Peace**

  

**Summary:** The **Nixon–Mao opening** (1972 Shanghai Communiqué) catalyzed Sino‑U.S. détente—an unintended “founding moment” of the Asian peace—emerging from shifting power balances, softening images, and domestic politics that enabled engaging a former enemy. Post‑1949 enmity (Korean War, revolutionary antagonism) gradually yielded to pragmatic coexistence, which **checked rivalry** and created conditions for broader regional stability and growth. The chapter stresses contingency: “Big outcomes often have small beginnings.” (pp. 29–30). 

**Key Points:**

- 1972 opening reframed Asia’s strategic geometry; détente became a stabilizer. 
    
- Domestic politics and perceptions mattered as enabling conditions. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Détente as peace driver; agency under structural constraints.
    

---

### **Chapter 3: Conservative Domination of Asia (Reagan Era)**

  

**Summary:** Reagan sought “peace through strength,” prioritizing military superiority and accepting high costs/risks to pressure the USSR. While the 1980s saw dangerous moments (e.g., 1983 war scares), Asia was a **low‑threat environment** compared with prior decades; U.S. force posture **expanded** and helped deter conflict, often as a secondary by‑product of anti‑Soviet strategy. Economic growth across NICs and deferred disputes also lowered war propensity. The result: stability owed partly to luck and partly to U.S. military predictability. (pp. 43–44, 70–71).

**Key Points:**

- Reagan’s wager: military superiority; risk: exacerbating security dilemmas. 
    
- Asia’s context enabled risk‑acceptant U.S. behavior without war. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Peace via deterrence + permissive environment; unintended stabilizing effects.
    

  

#### **Section 3.1: A Favorable Imbalance of Military Power**

  

**Summary:** Military expansion and demonstrations (“fight and win”) raised risks but bolstered regional deterrence; “I wanted peace through strength, not peace through a piece of paper” (p. 44). The stabilizing effects were **incidental** to Asia; priority remained the Soviet contest. 

**Key Points:**

- Forward presence and exercises increased; allies reassured. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Incidental peace dividends; alliance signaling.

### **Chapter 4: A Unipolar Imperium and Its Discontents (George H. W. Bush & Clinton)**

  

**Summary:** Post‑Cold War **unipolarity** produced Asia’s most peaceful modern era: Russia receded, Vietnam left Cambodia, worries about Japanese hegemony faded, and democratization advanced. U.S. policy first asserted continuity amid uncertainty, then embraced **liberal hubris** (APEC, IMF conditionality), sometimes aiding stability, sometimes constraining democratic sovereignty (e.g., Indonesia’s turbulence in 1998). Alliances and Sino‑U.S. engagement **buffered** Taiwan and enabled interdependence, but risks accumulated in North Korea and through uneven democratic effects. (pp. 71–73, 102–103).

**Key Points:**

- Unipolar moment = high stability + expanding interdependence. 
    
- U.S. economic statecraft had **two faces**: integration and constraints on sovereignty. 
    
- Alliances + engagement buffered flashpoints (e.g., Taiwan 1996). 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Liberal ordering as mixed blessing; stability through continuity.
    

---

### **Chapter 5: The War on Terror versus Great‑Power Competition (George W. Bush)**

  

**Summary:** After 9/11, the war on terror became “not just a priority, but the priority” (p. 107), diverting attention from Asia but **indirectly sparing** it the era’s most militaristic impulses. Military superiority logic persisted (2002 NSS), and alliances gained salience for burden sharing; Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and Thailand deepened cooperation. China policy shifted from “strategic competitor” to “responsible stakeholder,” while the Pentagon (ONA) quietly worried about Chinese **anti‑access** developments. In narrow terms, **defense bloat** stabilized Asian deployments; strategically, U.S. neglect postponed riskier policies in Asia. (pp. 107–117, 110–111, 116–117).

**Key Points:**

- War‑on‑terror focus froze Asia posture; alliances re‑purposed. 
    
- “Responsible stakeholder” détente reduced bilateral friction with China. 
    
- ONA seeded A2/AD concerns—hedging against future rivalry. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Aloof hegemony with stabilizing by‑products; siloed grand strategy.
    

  

#### **Section 5.1: Military Superiority Requires Allies**

  

**Summary:** The 2002 NSS reaffirmed dissuasion/primacy; allies’ symbolic and material contributions legitimated U.S. campaigns and indirectly **bolstered** regional confidence in U.S. staying power. (pp. 108–111). 

**Key Points:**

- Burden sharing > cost sharing; alliance politics reframed. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Alliance reassurance under non‑Asian priorities.

### **Chapter 6: Pivoting in Posthegemony Asia (Obama)**

  

**Summary:** The **global financial crisis** accelerated narratives of U.S. decline and Chinese ascent; Obama’s **pivot/rebalance** sought to correct geographic imbalance by recommitting to Asia’s “operating system.” The approach emphasized alliances (“backbone” of presence), incremental military laydown adjustments (Darwin rotations; EDCA), institutional engagement, and **managed détente** with China to avoid crisis spirals—even as Beijing grew more assertive. While stabilizing in context, U.S. economic regionalism lagged and democracy promotion proved **limited**. The era ended with eroding **quality of peace** and less certainty about the durability of its sources. (pp. 131–156).

**Key Points:**

- Rebalance = alliance centrality + measured posture shifts + rules‑based rhetoric. 
    
- Détente produced crisis‑management protocols; constrained escalation. 
    
- U.S. peripheral in new regional economic architectures; limits of “engagement.” 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Managing decline narratives; balancing reassurance and restraint.
    

  

#### **Section 6.1: Alliance Centrality**

  

**Summary:** Obama framed alliances as the **fulcrum** of the pivot (Clinton; DSG 2012), repeatedly affirming treaty networks as the backbone of presence and a rules‑based order. (pp. 133–134). 

**Key Points:**

- Institutionalized predictability as stabilizer; modest posture tweaks. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Liberal ordering via alliances.
    

  

#### **Section 6.2: Détente with China, Crisis Management**

  

**Summary:** Despite rising PRC assertiveness, U.S.–China cooperation included operational safety agreements; **détente** muted some escalatory dynamics (e.g., Scarborough/Senkaku counterfactuals). Yet Washington’s policy circle soured on engagement by 2016. (pp. 155–156). 

**Key Points:**

- Détente as shock absorber; elite consensus frayed late. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Great‑power relations as peace driver.
    

  

#### **Section 6.3: Regionalism & Democracy Promotion**

  

**Summary:** Engagement with institutions and democratic norms aimed to socialize behaviors but delivered **thin returns** on stabilization as security flashpoints outpaced multilateralism; democracy was at best neutral for peace. (p. 156). 

**Key Points:**

- Activity ≠ influence; economic regionalism deepened without U.S. centrality. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Limits of liberal intergovernmentalism.

### **Chapter 7: The Risk–Wager Imbalance of the Trump Era**

  

**Summary:** Trump centered a **sultanistic** foreign policy that was hyper‑militarized, mercantilist, anti‑multilateral, and rivalry‑first—**amplifying** longstanding habits under far less favorable conditions. Defense budgets surged; rhetoric invoked “peace through strength,” yet forward presence was questioned for cost reasons; allies were recast as “protectorates,” undermining confidence in U.S. competence. Taiwan signaling sharpened PRC ire; the **Korean Peninsula** saw acute nuclear‑crisis risk. The administration’s approach made the U.S. “Asia’s most volatile actor,” collapsing détente and embrittling peace’s foundations. (pp. 164–195, 166–185, 172–173).

**Key Points:**

- Military‑first “Indo‑Pacific” + decoupling rhetoric; rivalry without strategy. 
    
- Alliance shake‑downs (burden sharing as rent); competence doubts. 
    
- Korea crisis and Taiwan signaling increased war risk. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Risks without offsetting wagers; rivalry’s domestic/external pathologies.
    

  

#### **Section 7.1: Military‑First in the “Indo‑Pacific”**

  

**Summary:** Budgets climbed to historic highs; leadership sold “peace through strength,” but internal fights over forward presence exposed **strategic incoherence**. (pp. 166–167). 

**Key Points:**

- “Primacy” rhetoric masked inconsistent operational choices. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Means–ends misalignment.
    

---

### **Chapter 8: Searching for an Indo‑Pacific Peace (Conclusion)**

  

**Summary:** Jackson calls for recovering the **Asian peace as a referent narrative**, acknowledging how policy‑maker beliefs diverged from scholarly insights and often subordinated stability to other aims. He reassesses history to foreground **détente’s value**, the frequent (but incidental) stabilizing effects of U.S. aloofness, and the ways U.S. policy **unwittingly** gave China positional power through economic alienation. He offers **principles**: attack root causes of insecurity (oligarchy, labor precarity, climate), choose strategy over rivalry, and pursue anti‑hegemonic balancing while treating the **Indo‑Pacific** with prudence (contribute without new commitments; avoid entrapment). (pp. 200–211, 203–206, 208–211).

**Key Points:**

- Make the Asian peace the **policy heuristic**; price risks; pair risks with wagers. 
    
- Rivalry is costly; strategy must mitigate its domestic/foreign externalities. 
    
- Indo‑Pacific engagement: help stabilize without overcommitting. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Narrative discipline; structural humility; justice‑oriented statecraft.
    

  

#### **Section 8.1: Principles for an Indo‑Pacific Peace**

  

**Summary:** “Coercion and the use of force are sometimes necessary but also a trap” (p. 204); elevate statecraft to tackle root causes of insecurity, not just crisis symptoms. Avoid rivalry‑as‑default; if chosen, do so transparently after pricing downsides. Favor **anti‑hegemonic** balancing and contributions to Indian Ocean stability **without** new hard commitments; work in solidarity with frontline states to dampen incentives for conflict. (pp. 204–211).

**Key Points:**

- Diagnose/target social foundations (oligarchy, inequality, climate). 
    
- Rivalry narrows options, breeds domestic harms; strategy should widen them. 
    
    **Cross-Cutting Themes:** Peace as political economy + restraint; regional pluralism.
    

---

## **🎭 Central Themes**

- **Layered Peace:** Stability arises from **interlocking** mechanisms—power, economics, institutions, norms—whose weights shift over time. 
    
- **Risk–Wager Statecraft:** Evaluate choices by how they threaten or bolster the six indicators of peace. 
    
- **Narrative Matters:** Replace flattering myths of U.S. benevolence with a more accurate paradox to guide policy. 
    
- **Détente’s Hidden Work:** Great‑power cooperation as an undervalued peace driver. 
    
- **Rivalry Caution:** Militarized competition without strategy embrittles peace and corrodes democracy. 
    

  

## **📖 Historiographical Context**

- Engages realist accounts (e.g., **American pacifier/primacy**, selective engagement), liberal institutionalist and democratic‑peace claims, and constructivist **ASEAN‑way** narratives—arguing each captures **partial truths** that function together.
    
- Inserts the **East Asian peace** literature (Tønnesson; Kivimäki) and critiques “single‑cause” explanations; stresses regional (not unit‑level) logics. 
    
- Reinterprets post‑1979 history via **risk–wager** lens, re‑valuing détente and exposing how U.S. policy often **prioritized other goals** over preventing war. 
    

  

## **🧩 Frameworks & Methods**

- **Six Indicators** guiding diagnosis: U.S. forward presence; U.S. alliances; great‑power détente; interdependence; regionalism; democracy/good governance. (p. 26). 
    
- **Risk–Wager Balance:** conceptual grammar for interpreting presidential choices; used across “case histories” to track continuity/change. (pp. 27–28).
    
- Sources: policy documents (e.g., 2002 NSS), elite memoirs, declassified reports, academic works; cross‑case presidential narrative from Nixon to Trump.

## **🧐 Critical Reflections**

- **Strengths:** Clear analytical apparatus (six indicators + risk–wager); integrates competing IR schools into a **coherent layered model**; rescues **détente** from underappreciation; bridges academic and practitioner discourses; policy‑relevant concluding principles.
    
- **Weaknesses / Blind Spots:** Limited microfoundations for how elites **update** risks; under‑specifies when democracy/regionalism **tip** from neutral to stabilizing; economic statecraft remedies are sketched at a high level. _Evidence for some sub‑national causal claims (oligarchy‑labor‑nationalism linkages) relies on inference rather than direct archival demonstration._ 
    
- **Unresolved Questions:** How to operationalize “offsetting wagers” in real budgets; calibrating alliance reassurance vs. entrapment; designing **anti‑hegemonic** balancing that doesn’t drift back into primacy habits. 
    

  

## **⚔️ Comparative Insights**

- **Against primacy monism (Mearsheimer; Posen/Ross):** Jackson’s six‑factor model argues primacy alone cannot explain stability or guide policy; forward presence helps but requires **détente/interdependence** to be durable. 
    
- **Beyond ASEAN‑centrism (Acharya et al.):** Norms/institutions matter, but their effects are **conditional** and intertwined with power/economy. 
    
- **With East Asian peace literature (Tønnesson/Kivimäki):** Confirms “relative peace,” pushes further by making it a **policy heuristic** and adding risk‑wager discipline. 
    

  

## **✍️ Key Terms**

- **Asian peace:** Post‑1979 absence of interstate war in East Asia/Pacific (relative, not absolute). 
    
- **Risk–wager balance:** Framework for judging whether policy choices undercut or invest in peace drivers. 
    
- **Aloof hegemon / vital bulwark / imperious superpower:** The three faces of U.S. conduct toward Asian stability. 
    
- **Dual‑hierarchical order:** U.S. security–China economic hubs enabling hedging. 
    
- **A2/AD (anti‑access/area‑denial):** Pentagon lens on China’s military challenge. 
    
- **Free and Open Indo‑Pacific (FOIP):** Rivalry‑inflected regional framing of late 2010s. 
    

  

## **❓ Open Questions**

- What concrete **offsetting wagers** should accompany necessary risks (e.g., Taiwan, alliance cost debates)? 
    
- Can **détente‑like** cooperation on crisis management be rebuilt without conceding on values or security? 
    
- How can U.S. economic statecraft reduce **positional power** gains for China while avoiding coercive overreach?
