# Strategic Narratives

## Online Description

Communication is central to how we understand international affairs. Political leaders, diplomats, and citizens recognize that communication shapes global politics. This has only been amplified in a new media environment characterized by Internet access to information, social media, and the transformation of who can communicate and how. Soft power, public diplomacy 2.0, network power – scholars and policymakers are concerned with understanding what is happening. This book is the first to develop a systematic framework to understand how political actors seek to shape order through narrative projection in this new environment. To explain the changing world order – the rise of the BRICS, the dilemmas of climate change, poverty and terrorism, the intractability of conflict – the authors explore how actors form and project narratives and how third parties interpret and interact with these narratives. The concept of strategic narrative draws together the most salient of international relations concepts, including the links between power and ideas; international and domestic; and state and non-state actors. The book is anchored around four themes: order, actors, uncertainty, and contestation. Through these, Strategic Narratives shows both the possibilities and the limits of communication and power, and makes an important contribution to theorizing and studying empirically contemporary international relations.

## **🧭 60‑Second Brief**

- **Core claim (1–2 sentences):** Strategic narratives—purposeful stories about the system, actors’ identities, and specific issues—are tools of power that shape how audiences understand the past, present, and future, thereby structuring expectations and behavior at home and abroad. Their effectiveness hinges on formation–projection–reception dynamics within evolving media ecologies and on contestation across multiple audiences. 
    
- **Causal mechanism in a phrase:** **Formation → Projection → Reception** in a contested media ecology, producing **behavioral** and **constitutive** effects. 
    
- **Paradigm & level(s) of analysis:** Constructivist core with bridges to rationalist/communicative approaches; individual, state, dyadic, and systemic levels.
    
- **Why it matters for policy/strategy (1–2 bullets):**
    
    - Narrative design must join up **content + process (who/when/where)** and anticipate contestation and gatekeeping; otherwise credibility erodes and rivals fill the space.
        
    - **Saying is doing**: speech acts commit actors and can entrap or empower them; mitigate “say–do” gaps. 
        
    

  

## **🧪 Theory Map (IR)**

- **Paradigm(s):** Primarily **constructivism** (identity, norms, discourse), incorporating **rationalist** (signaling/entrapment) and **communicative action** strands via a **thin–thick spectrum of persuasion**. 
    
- **Level(s) of analysis:** **Individual** (leaders/communicators), **State**, **Dyadic**, **Systemic** (order). 
    
- **Unit(s) of analysis:** Narratives (system/identity/issue), political actors (states, IOs, NGOs, media), and **media ecologies** (gatekeepers/infrastructure).
    
- **Dependent variable(s):** Audience **opinions/behavior**, coalition formation (e.g., UNSCR votes), policy legitimation, and identity (self/other) redefinition.
    
- **Key independent variable(s):** Narrative content and **credibility**, normative **fit**, **timing**, **author/guarantor**, and information infrastructure/gatekeeping.
    
- **Causal mechanism(s):** Strategic narrativization of events + **performative speech acts** + diffusion through hybrid media → audience uptake (or resistance) → behavioral/constitutive change.
    
- **Scope conditions:** High salience crises; plural media ecologies; multiple audiences; **no template for success**—effects are contingent and contested. 
    
- **Observable implications / predictions:** (i) Narratives with **normative resonance** and **credible guarantors** gain traction; (ii) misalignment or hypocrisy cues reduce trust; (iii) infrastructure control shapes who hears what.
    
- **Potential falsifiers / disconfirming evidence:** Strongly projected narratives **fail** to shift behavior (e.g., Iran case; limited impact of Obama’s Cairo speech); clear comprehension yet **persistent disagreement**.

## **✅ Direct Responses to Course Questions**

  

**Q1. How does Goddard use legitimacy as an explanation?**

**Answer:** _Not found in the provided source._ Within **Miskimmon et al.**, legitimacy explains policy acceptance when narratives make a policy appear **normatively desirable and achievable**, tied to elite–public interaction and two‑level dynamics (agenda setting, altercasting). (p. 12–13)  ✓

  

**Q2. How is legitimacy determined?**

**Answer:** By whether a policy **fits accepted narratives**, resonates with norms, and is **projected/timed** to avoid charges of hypocrisy; legitimacy is co‑produced domestically and internationally via communication processes. (pp. 12–13, 157–160)  ✓

  

**Q3. Are legitimacy and credibility the same?**

**Answer:** No. **Legitimacy** = normative acceptability (“should” and “can”); **credibility** = perceptions of **truth‑seeking, reliability, and word–deed consistency** (“will”). Credibility is performed through “**credibility talk**” and trusted guarantors; hypocrisy cues erode it. (pp. 158–160, 173–174)  ✓

  

**Q4. What is necessary for an effective signal?**

**Answer:** Clear informational and emotional content; **normative fit**; **timeliness**; **credible authors/guarantors**; and alignment of words with deeds (“**saying is doing**”). Signals must traverse gatekeepers and be framed for target audiences. (pp. 153–160, 159–160, 251)  ✓

  

**Q5. How can we investigate perceptions in the international system?**

**Answer:** **Trace formation → projection → reception**, measure before/after **attitudes/behavior**, map **circuits of communication** and **gatekeeping** in the relevant media ecology, and use mixed methods (online/offline). (pp. 261–263, 17–18, 209–210)  ✓

  

**Q6. What is the role of strategic narratives?**

**Answer:** They **structure order, identities, and issue agendas**, producing **behavioral** (A gets B to do X) and **constitutive** (shaping identities/roles) power effects; leaders use them to legitimate policies and align expectations. (pp. 26–27, 249–251)  ✓

  

**Q7. Does this role conflict with the use of other’s narratives in the international arena?**

**Answer:** It **coexists with and depends on contestation**; actors borrow, counter, or entrap via others’ narratives (altercasting, rhetorical traps). The “battle of narratives” is **enduring competition**, not a one‑off conflict. (pp. 5–6, 12–13, 196–197)  ✓

  

**Q8. How does identity interact with narratives?**

**Answer:** Identity and behavior **work in tandem**; narratives define **self/other**, roles, and appropriate action, and actors strategically narrate to **(re)construct** identities across domestic and international audiences. (pp. 26–28, 45–49)  ✓

  

## **📚 Section-by-Section Notes**

  

### **Preface**

- **Purpose:** Motivate the project from power transitions, War on Terror, and the 2008 financial crisis; show why narrative work often fails amid a shifting media ecology. 
    
- **Key claims:** Leaders attempt to legitimize policy through narratives; communication failure is common; media change complicates control. (p. xi) 
    
- **Implications:** Expect difficulty in “influencing foreigners”; invest in design for contestation.
    

  

### **Series Editor Foreword**

- **Purpose:** Distinguish **what narratives are** vs **what they do**; preview the book’s contribution. (p. xiv) 
    
- **Takeaway:** Effects depend on conditions of use, not merely identification.
    

  

### **Chapter 1: Introduction**

- **Purpose:** Define **strategic narratives** and situate them in a changing **media ecology**. 
    
- **Key claims:** Narratives are central to human relations; political actors use them strategically; communication environment shapes effects. (pp. 1–3) 
    
- **Framework:** Three types—**system**, **identity**, **issue**—and the **formation–projection–reception** process. (pp. 10–12) 
    
- **Implications:** Power transition outcomes hinge on **narrative alignment** among great powers. (p. 2) 
    

  

### **Chapter 2: Actors in Strategic Narratives**

- **Purpose:** Tie narratives to **identity** and specify actors in a new media ecology. 
    
- **Key claims:** Identity shapes interests/behavior; narratives specify actors, roles, motives; nonstate actors and publics matter more under new transparency and interactivity. (pp. 45–49, 16–18)
    
- **Evidence/examples:** U.S. great‑power narrative construction in the 1940s; EU identity work; climate diplomacy; terrorist media use. (pp. 45–46) 
    
- **Implications:** Narrative work can **constitute** identities (e.g., “states‑who‑protect”). (pp. 26–27) 
    

  

### **Chapter 3: Strategic Narratives of International Order**

- **Purpose:** Show how order is made meaningful and contested via narratives; **Libya 2011** case. 
    
- **Key claims:** States project **system narratives** to shape hierarchy, law, and norms; success requires working through multiple constituencies and infrastructures. (pp. 152–154) 
    
- **Evidence/examples:** **Libya/UNSCR 1973**—Franco‑British **R2P** narrative influenced U.S. consent; China/Russia abstentions; German dissent. Tables **3.1–3.3** map **formation**, **projection**, **reception**. (pp. 105–122)
    
- **Implications:** Thin persuasion may secure votes while straining alliances (EU cohesion). (p. 105) 
    

  

### **Chapter 4: Contestation**

- **Purpose:** Theorize **how narratives clash**; introduce **spectrum of persuasion** and **aspects of contestation**. (pp. 196–197, 153–160)
    
- **Key claims:** Contestation targets both narrative **content** (information, emotion, epistemology, **ambiguity**) and **process** (formation, projection, reception). (pp. 153–160) 
    
- **Evidence/examples:** Israel–neighbors conflicts; global **anti‑whaling** shift; **Iran nuclear** diplomacy—showing limits of persuasion. (pp. 196–197) 
    
- **Implications:** Long‑term **discursive shifts** require thick persuasion; short‑term traps show thin persuasion. 
    

  

### **Chapter 5: Information Infrastructure**

- **Purpose:** Link narrative power to **media ecologies** and **infrastructure control**. (pp. 209–210) 
    
- **Key claims:** Practitioners must both **work within** and **shape** infrastructures; old and new media have hybridized; **gatekeeping** persists and morphs. (pp. 221–223, 262–263)
    
- **Evidence/examples:** **Obama’s 2009 Cairo speech**—major effort to create dialogic spaces but limited penetration and **no short‑term observable benefit**; **BBC Arabic** impact monitoring. (pp. 223–232)
    
- **Implications:** Infrastructure work is part of strategy; whose narrative “wins” depends partly on **institution‑building/tech transfer**. (p. 209) 
    

  

### **Chapter 6: Conclusions—Thinking Ahead**

- **Purpose:** Synthesize: narratives matter but effects are **conditional** and **hard to secure**. (pp. 249–251) 
    
- **Key claims:** Take seriously **what we say** and **how**; design strategies that integrate **formation–projection–reception**, place aims along the **thin–thick** spectrum, and plan for contestation. (pp. 249–251) 
    
- **Future agenda:** Test effects at critical junctures; connect culture/civilization and narrative work; map hybrid gatekeeping. (pp. 258–270) 
    

  

## **🧩 Key Concepts & Definitions (author’s usage)**

- **Strategic narrative:** Purposeful story to construct shared meaning about system/identity/issues to shape opinions and behavior. (p. 249) 
    
- **System / Identity / Issue narratives:** System = what the order is/should be; Identity = who we/they are; Issue = how specific problems should be framed/resolved. (pp. 10–12) 
    
- **Spectrum of persuasion:** From **thin** (tactical trapping/coercion) to **thick** (constituting identities/interests). (pp. 196–197) 
    
- **Aspects of contestation:** Informational content, emotional content, epistemology, **ambiguity**, relation to action, and processes of **formation/projection/reception**. (pp. 153–160) 
    
- **Policy legitimacy:** Convincing others a policy is **achievable** and **normatively desirable**; enhanced by fit with accepted narratives. (pp. 12–13) 
    
- **Credibility talk:** Performance signaling truth‑seeking/reliability to be trusted as a partner; distinct from truth itself. (pp. 173–174) 
    
- **“Saying is doing”:** Speech acts commit and constrain; gaps invite hypocrisy charges. (p. 251; pp. 158–160)
    
- **Media ecology / infrastructure:** Overlapping environments, actors, and technologies that condition narrative circulation and reception; gatekeeping persists in networked forms. (pp. 17–18, 262–263) 
    

  

## **🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Actors & Perspectives**

- **Great powers** — Project system narratives; face identity pressures to “lead”; vulnerable to say–do gaps. (pp. 2, 251)
    
- **Rising/weak states** — Use narratives to claim roles, seek legitimacy, or resist others’ frames. (pp. 45–49) 
    
- **IOs/NGOs/activists** — Can drive thick persuasion (e.g., anti‑whaling) and shape epistemic standards. (p. 197) 
    
- **Media organizations/gatekeepers** — Reinterpret or block narratives; hybrid gatekeeping matters. (pp. 221–223, 262–263)
    
- **Publics/audiences** — Not blank slates; politically/media‑literate; discuss and remix narratives. (pp. 17–18, 29) 
    

  

## **🕰 Timeline of Major Events**

- **1940s** — U.S. great‑power narrative constructed; templates for Cold War legitimation. Significance: durable identity frames policy. (pp. 45–46) 
    
- **2003** — Iraq War justifications foreground narrative legitimation; Castells link to communication power. Significance: speech acts as order‑making. (pp. 3–4) 
    
- **2008** — Global financial crisis triggers competing order narratives. Significance: narratives of blame/solution. (p. xi) 
    
- **2009‑06‑04** — Obama’s Cairo speech. Significance: infrastructure‑heavy projection; limited near‑term impact. (pp. 223–232)
    
- **2011‑03‑17** — **UNSCR 1973 (Libya)**. Significance: R2P‑framed system narrative secures consent/abstentions; EU split. (pp. 105–122)
    
- **1960s–70s** — Anti‑whaling narrative diffuses. Significance: thick persuasion reshapes policy and identities. (p. 197) 
    

  

## **🧠 Policy & Strategy Takeaways**

- **Implications for today’s policy choices:**
    
    - **Design for contestation**: plan content **and** processes (credible messengers, timing, venues) with clear feedback loops. (pp. 249–251) 
        
    - **Map gatekeepers/circuits** before launching campaigns; hybrid media can reroute signals. (pp. 221–223, 262–263)
        
    - **Align with norms** (“work with the grain”) to broaden coalitions. (p. 173) 
        
    
- **R/B/C (Risks/Benefits/Conditions):**
    
    - **Risk:** Hypocrisy cues → credibility loss. **Benefit:** Timely, norm‑congruent signals → faster uptake. **Conditions:** Credible guarantors; cross‑audience tailoring. (pp. 158–160) 
        
    
- **If this logic is right, a policymaker should…**
    
    - Pre‑clear narrative **ambiguity bounds**; pick **who** will speak and be the **guarantor**; sequence messages to shape others’ options without overpromising. (pp. 157–160) 
        
    

  

## **⚔️ Comparative Placement in the IR Canon**

- **Closest kin / contrasts:** Strongly **constructivist** (identity, norms, discourse), yet bridges to **rationalist signaling** and **communicative action** via the thin–thick persuasion spectrum. (pp. 196–197) 
    
- **How it differs:** Goes beyond “soft power” by specifying **narrative mechanisms** and **infrastructure conditions** (gatekeeping, platform design). (pp. 12–13, 209–210)
    
- **Placement:** A synthetic framework linking **actors, order, contestation, infrastructure**—a communication‑centred account of power transitions. (pp. 28–39) 
    

  

## **🧐 Critical Reflections**

- **Strengths:** Integrates content **and** process; multi‑level; empirically grounded across cases; clarifies **how** narratives do work. (pp. 249–251) 
    
- **Weaknesses / blind spots:** Causal identification remains hard; success conditions are contingent; practitioners may find guidance **non‑templated**. (p. 253) 
    
- **What would change your mind?** Clear counter‑cases where norm‑congruent, credibly projected narratives consistently **fail** across audiences and infrastructures, or where infrastructure control **doesn’t** affect diffusion (cf. Cairo). (pp. 223–232) 
    

  

## **❓ Open Questions for Seminar**

- When (if ever) can **thick** identity change be engineered quickly, or is it path‑dependent and generational? (pp. 196–197) 
    
- What are ethical limits of **ambiguity** in strategic narratives before legitimacy collapses? (pp. 157–160)

## **📝 Exam Drills**

- **Likely prompt:** “Explain how strategic narratives shape international order. Distinguish thin vs. thick persuasion and illustrate with Libya (2011) and one communication case.”
    
    **Skeleton answer (3‑part outline):**
    
    1. **Define & scope:** Strategic narratives (system/identity/issue); formation–projection–reception; media ecology & gatekeeping. (pp. 10–12, 262–263)
        
    2. **Mechanisms:** Thin traps vs. thick identity work; aspects of contestation (content/process); credibility & say–do alignment. (pp. 153–160, 196–197, 158–160)
        
    3. **Apply:** Libya—R2P narrative secures UNSCR 1973 amid EU split (thin win); Cairo—heavy infrastructure work, limited short‑term impact (gatekeeping). (pp. 105–122, 223–232)
