# After Hegemony

## Online Description

Examines the current state of international politics and economics, discusses theories of rational cooperation, and considers the importance of institutions
  

## **🧭 60‑Second Brief**

- **Core claim (1–2 sentences):** Durable cooperation is possible under anarchy even after the decline of a hegemon because **international regimes**—enduring principles, norms, rules, and procedures—reduce uncertainty and transaction costs, supply information, and enable decentralized enforcement through reciprocity and reputation. 
    
- **Causal mechanism in a phrase:** **Rule‑guided, information‑rich iteration** → lower transaction costs & uncertainty → credible reciprocity/reputation → sustained policy coordination.
    
- **Paradigm & level(s) of analysis:** Institutionalism on Realist foundations; primarily systemic/state level.
    
- **Why it matters for policy/strategy (1–2 bullets):**
    
    - Don’t rely on hegemonic dominance; **design and maintain regimes** that provide information and predictable rules. 
        
    - **Accept some constraints (“tie yourself to the mast”)** to gain predictability and reduce risk. 
        
    

  

## **🧪 Theory Map (IR)**

- **Paradigm(s):** Institutionalism that incorporates Realist assumptions about power/egoism; critique and partial uptake of Hegemonic Stability Theory (HST).
    
- **Level(s) of analysis:** **Systemic** (rules, regimes, power distribution); **State** (government strategies under bounded rationality).
    
- **Unit(s) of analysis:** States (principal actors), with roles for international organizations and **transgovernmental networks**.
    
- **Dependent variable(s):** Degree/persistence of **international cooperation** (policy coordination), regime maintenance/change. 
    
- **Key independent variable(s):** Information provision; transaction costs; iteration/repetition; reciprocity & reputation; issue‑linkage; number of actors; hegemonic support (esp. for regime **creation**); decision costs (bounded rationality).
    
- **Causal mechanism(s):** Regimes generate **symmetrical information**, standardize expectations, limit strategy sets, and **enable decentralized retaliation** (“tit‑for‑tat”) that sustains cooperation among egoists.
    
- **Scope conditions:** Anarchy/self‑help persists; **complementary interests** exist; interactions are **repeated** among a manageable number of major actors; existing institutional density matters; governments face **bounded rationality**.
    
- **Observable implications / predictions:**
    
    - Regimes are **easier to maintain than to create**; persistence after hegemonic decline, with adaptation across issue areas.
        
    - Variation across **money, trade, oil**; cooperation and discord **coexist** post‑hegemony. 
        
    
- **Potential falsifiers / disconfirming evidence:** No cooperation after hegemony; cooperation appears mainly in **“wrong places”** (e.g., many small states without great‑power leadership, or single‑play PD issues); agreements mostly ad hoc **outside** regimes.

## **✅ Direct Responses to Course Questions**

  

**Q1. What role do regimes play in continuity and change of the international system?**

**Answer:** Regimes **mediate** between power shifts and state behavior, sustaining **continuity** by reducing uncertainty and transaction costs, generating transgovernmental ties, and standardizing expectations; they also **adapt** and sometimes **self‑limit** innovation, shaping how change unfolds. They are **easier to maintain than create**, which helps explain persistence after hegemonic decline. (p. 100–103, 210–211, 182–183)  ✓

  

**Q2. What influences cooperation, according to Keohane?**

**Answer:** Cooperation is fostered by **shared/complementary interests**, repeated interaction, **information** and monitoring, **lower transaction costs**, **issue‑linkage**, credible **reciprocity** (reputation/retaliation), manageable numbers of actors, and decision rules that economize on **bounded rationality**. (p. 83–85; 89–91; 100–106; 103–104; 114–116; 213)  ✓

  

**Q3. Why is cooperation difficult to achieve?**

**Answer:** Under **anarchy/self‑help**, sovereignty and the possibility of coercion persist; uncertainty and **high transaction costs** impede agreement; distributional conflicts and domestic pressures (e.g., protectionism) complicate bargains; enforcement is **decentralized**, so actors fear defection. (p. 61–62; 100; 224–226; 104–105; 46)  ✓

  

**Q4. What is the relationship between hegemony and international institutions?**

**Answer:** **Symbiotic**: hegemons often **create** regimes and invest in institutions to embed preferred rules; yet **cooperation can persist after hegemony** because established regimes lower uncertainty and facilitate coordination. Hegemony is **neither necessary nor sufficient** for order. (p. 45–46; 49–50; 100)  ✓

  

**Q5. What conditions or factors complicate Keohane’s theory?**

**Answer:** Issue‑area variation (money/trade/oil), domestic politics, macroeconomic shifts, and **learning/ideas** complicate causal stories; the theory is **non‑deterministic** and sets explicit **falsifiers** (e.g., no post‑hegemonic cooperation). (p. 182–183; 28–29, 146; 213; 219–220)  ✓

  

**Q6. What levers of influence does Keohane identify for us and how do they operate to create change in state behavior?**

**Answer:** **Design/manipulate regimes** to: supply **information**; reduce **transaction costs**; **link issues**; structure **decision procedures**; cultivate **transgovernmental networks**; and **bind** future behavior (accepting obligations to gain predictability). These levers shift incentives toward longer time horizons and cooperative equilibria. (p. 89–91; 100–103; 103–104; 100; 115–116; 257–258)  ✓

  

## **📚 Section-by-Section Notes**

  

### **Chapter 1: Realism, Institutionalism, and Cooperation**

- **Purpose:** Frame the puzzle—**cooperation without hegemony**—and position Institutionalism alongside Realism. 
    
- **Key claims:** We must go **beyond Realism, not discard it**; power matters, but so do institutions that shape expectations. (p. 9) 
    
- **Implications:** Set up a synthesis: Realist premises + Institutional mechanisms. 
    

  

### **Chapter 2: Politics, Economics, and the International System**

- **Purpose:** Define **wealth & power** goals; justify a primarily **systemic** analysis with states as crucial actors. (pp. 24–25) 
    
- **Key claims:** States seek wealth/power and build frameworks of rules to secure them; contrasts inside‑out vs outside‑in explanations. 
    
- **Implications:** Cooperation is instrumentally valuable to states’ goals. 
    

  

### **Chapter 3: Hegemony in the World Political Economy**

- **Purpose:** Assess HST; relate hegemony to cooperation. 
    
- **Key claims:** HST’s general claims are **overstated**; hegemony and cooperation are **symbiotic**; hegemons must often **invest in institutions**. (pp. 45–46) 
    
- **Implications:** Hegemony helps **create** order, but it’s not a permanent or sufficient condition. 
    

  

### **Chapter 4: Cooperation and International Regimes**

- **Purpose:** Define **cooperation** and **regimes**; distinguish from **harmony/discord**. (pp. 50–58, 63) 
    
- **Key claims:** Cooperation is **policy coordination** amid potential conflict; regimes are shared **principles, norms, rules, procedures** guiding expectations. (pp. 50–58, 63) 
    
- **Limits:** In a **self‑help** system, regime rules are fragile absent supporting interests. (pp. 61–62) 
    

  

### **Chapter 5: Rational‑Choice and Functional Explanations**

- **Purpose:** Show how **egoists** can cooperate without hegemony under certain conditions. (pp. 83–85) 
    
- **Key claims:** With repeated play and credible reciprocity, institutions can help **solve coordination/PD problems**. 
    

  

### **Chapter 6: A Functional Theory of International Regimes**

- **Purpose:** Articulate why regimes are **valuable**. (pp. 89–106) 
    
- **Key claims:** Regimes **lower transaction costs**, **reduce uncertainty**, create **information symmetry**, promote **issue‑linkage**, and are **easier to maintain than to create**. (pp. 100–104)
    
- **Mechanisms:** Regimes foster **transgovernmental networks** that sustain cooperation. (p. 100) 
    

  

### **Chapter 7: Bounded Rationality and Redefinitions of Self‑Interest**

- **Purpose:** Relax perfect rationality; consider **rules of thumb** and **empathy**. (pp. 110–116, 123–131)
    
- **Key claims:** Bounded rationality **increases** the value of regimes (multilateral rules substitute for unilateral rules); reciprocity can be **negative, balanced, generalized**; empathy may expand perceived common interests. (pp. 115–116, 128–131, 123–124)
    

  

### **Chapter 8: Hegemonic Cooperation in the Postwar Era**

- **Purpose:** Show how U.S. leadership **constructed** postwar monetary/trade regimes and managed oil. (pp. 149–177)
    
- **Key claims/evidence:** Bretton Woods **par‑value** system functioned as intended by late 1950s; the **Suez oil‑lift (1956–57)** illustrates hegemonic cooperation with firms and allies. (pp. 149–150, 169–173)
    
- **Implication:** Hegemony can **substitute** for regimes temporarily, but domestic politics limited U.S. leadership. (pp. 173–177) 
    

  

### **Chapter 9: The Incomplete Decline of Hegemonic Regimes**

- **Purpose:** Trace regime change 1960s–early 1980s in **money, trade, oil**. (pp. 183–224) 
    
- **Key claims:** HST explains **part** of change, but **cooperation persisted** where regimes adapted; **institutions mattered** for expectations/transactions. (pp. 182–183, 208–209, 222–223)
    
- **Trade politics:** Domestic pressures complicate cooperation. (p. 210–213) 
    

  

### **Chapter 10: The Consumers’ Oil Regime, 1974–81**

- **Purpose:** Case of post‑hegemonic cooperation: **IEA**. (pp. 219–240) 
    
- **Key claims:** Without an ongoing regime, the U.S. had to **accept contingent obligations** (e.g., oil sharing) to build credibility; the regime’s performance was **mixed** (1979 “fiasco,” 1980 improvement). (pp. 219–221, 16)
    
- **Mechanism:** Small‑N, repeated interaction + rules lowered defection incentives. (pp. 219–221) 
    

  

### **Chapter 11: The Value of Institutions and the Costs of Flexibility**

- **Purpose:** Normative/policy wrap‑up.
    
- **Key claims:** Information is a **public good** regimes can produce; sometimes it is rational to **bind oneself** (“Ulysses to the mast”) because **excess flexibility is costly**. (pp. 257–258) 
    

  

## **🧩 Key Concepts & Definitions (author’s usage)**

- **Cooperation:** “A process that involves the use of **discord** to stimulate **mutual adjustment**” and policy coordination—distinct from harmony. (pp. 46, 50–51, 63)
    
- **International regimes:** Enduring **principles, norms, rules, procedures** around which actor expectations converge; not world government. (pp. 57–58) 
    
- **Harmony vs cooperation vs discord:** Harmony makes cooperation unnecessary; cooperation happens amid potential conflict; discord can be instrumental. (pp. 50–51, 46)
    
- **Reciprocity:** Negative, balanced, and **generalized** forms; regimes facilitate **non‑simultaneous** exchange and credibly commit parties. (pp. 128–131) 
    
- **Bounded rationality:** Decision costs make **rules of thumb** and regime rules attractive substitutes for case‑by‑case calculation. (pp. 114–116) 
    

  

## **🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Actors & Perspectives**

- **Great powers/hegemon:** Create and underwrite regimes; may trade short‑run costs for long‑run **influence**; but domestic politics can undercut leadership. (pp. 24–25, 173–177)
    
- **International organizations (IMF/GATT/IEA):** **Information hubs** and coordinators; adapted to post‑1971 monetary world. (pp. 208–209, 219–221)
    
- **Transgovernmental officials/networks:** Regularized contact builds trust, **symmetrical information**, and informal coalitions. (p. 100) 
    
- **Domestic groups/industries:** Shape state preferences; e.g., protectionist pressures. (pp. 210–213) 
    

  

## **🕰 Timeline of Major Events**

- **1944–1958** — Bretton Woods regime consolidated (par‑value, IMF centrality); trade regime embedded; cooperation flourishes. **Significance:** Hegemonic leadership builds liberal regimes. (pp. 149–150) 
    
- **1956–1957** — **Suez crisis** and Emergency Oil Lift: U.S. orchestrates company/government coordination to supply Europe. **Significance:** Archetype of **hegemonic cooperation**. (pp. 169–173) 
    
- **1971–1973** — **Bretton Woods breakdown** (Nixon shock; float). **Significance:** Rules changed, but institutional **principles** and cooperation persisted/adapted. (pp. 206–209, 222–223)
    
- **1973–1974** — **Oil crisis**; IEA formed. **Significance:** Post‑hegemonic regime built via contingent commitments. (pp. 219–221) 
    
- **1979–1980** — IEA **fiasco** then partial success. **Significance:** Regime limits and learning under stress. (p. 16) 
    

  

## **🧠 Policy & Strategy Takeaways**

- **Invest in regimes as information systems:** Fund, staff, and protect reporting/monitoring to reduce uncertainty for all sides. (p. 100) 
    
- **Design for reciprocity & iteration:** Build procedures that make **retaliation** credible yet proportionate (“tit‑for‑tat”) to deter defection. (pp. 104–105, 213)
    
- **Use issue‑linkage and binding commitments:** Link bargains across issues; sometimes **self‑bind** to enhance credibility and stabilize expectations. (pp. 103–104, 257–258)
    
- **R/B/C:** **Risks**: over‑demanding partners exploit regime value; **Benefits**: predictability & lower risk; **Conditions**: repeated play, shared interests, robust information. (pp. 213, 100–103)
    

  

## **⚔️ Comparative Placement in the IR Canon**

- **Closest kin / contrasts:** Sits between **Realism** (power/hegemony) and **Institutionalism** (regimes/expectations). **Differs** from strong HST (hegemony not necessary/sufficient). (pp. 45–46; 9)
    
- **Placement:** Institutionalism with Realist microfoundations—**beyond Realism, not discarding it**. (p. 9) 
    

  

## **🧐 Critical Reflections**

- **Strengths:** Clear mechanisms (information/transactions/reciprocity); explicit **scope** and **falsifiers**; careful issue‑area comparisons. (pp. 100–106; 219–220)
    
- **Weaknesses / blind spots:** Acknowledged **non‑determinism**; heavy focus on advanced industrial states; testing requires **time‑series** beyond author’s horizon. (pp. 182–183; 219–220)
    
- **What would change your mind?** Persistent **failure** of post‑hegemonic cooperation, or cooperation led by small states on **single‑play** issues absent regimes. (p. 219–220) 
    

  

## **❓ Open Questions for Seminar**

- When do regimes become **self‑limiting**, requiring shocks to expand cooperation? (pp. 210–211) 
    
- How much **domestic politics** (elections, lobbies) can regimes absorb before cooperation unravels? (pp. 210–213) 
    

  

## **✍️ Notable Quotes (with pages)**

- “Cooperation… **involves the use of discord to stimulate mutual adjustment**.” (p. 46) 
    
- “**Cooperation must be distinguished from harmony**.” (p. 50) 
    
- “**Regimes are easier to maintain than they are to create**.” (p. 100) 
    
- “**Hegemony and cooperation are… found in symbiotic relationships**.” (pp. 45–46) 
    
- “Regimes… **empower governments rather than shackling them**.” (p. 13) 
    
- “It may be better, on occasion, **to have oneself tied to the mast**.” (pp. 257–258) 
    

  

## **📝 Exam Drills**

- **Likely prompt:** “Explain how Keohane shows that cooperation can persist **after hegemony**. Identify the mechanisms and apply them to one post‑1973 issue area.”
    
    **Skeleton answer (3‑part outline):**
    
    1. **Thesis:** Cooperation persists because regimes provide information, reduce transaction costs, and enable **reciprocity** under anarchy (not because of hegemony alone). (p. 100–106) 
        
    2. **Mechanisms & scope:** Define cooperation vs harmony; show **maintenance > creation**; add bounded rationality and **rules of thumb**; note conditions (iteration, shared interests). (pp. 50–51, 100, 114–116)
        
    3. **Application:** Briefly analyze **IEA** (1974–81): initial commitments to build credibility; mixed performance; lessons on information/iteration/obligations. (pp. 219–221)
