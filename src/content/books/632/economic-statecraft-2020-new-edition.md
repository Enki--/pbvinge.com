## **🧭 60-Second Brief**

- **Core claim (1–2 sentences):** Economic statecraft is a general **means of influence**—using instruments with market-denominated value—to shape others’ behavior; its utility has been underestimated because analysts conflate effectiveness with efficiency, ignore alternatives, and treat success/failure as binary.   
    
- **Causal mechanism in a phrase:** **Influence by incentives and signals**—adjusting others’ costs/benefits (carrots & sticks) and conveying intentions/resolve.   
    
- **Paradigm & level(s) of analysis:** Mid-range, instrument-focused analysis compatible with realism & liberalism; **state** and **dyadic/systemic** levels (comparative across tools). 
    
- **Why it matters for policy/strategy (1–2 bullets):**
    
    - Lets strategists **shape the battlespace before force**—including warning, reassurance, and time-buying—often at lower cost/risk than military options. 
        
    - Today’s toolkit (e.g., targeted/financial sanctions; dollar leverage) expands **scalable, precise options** aligned with war-prevention priorities.   
        
    

  

## **🧪 Theory Map (IR)**

- **Paradigm(s):** Eclectic instrumentarian: compatible with **realist** power politics and **liberal** interdependence; centrally about **means–ends** choice. 
    
- **Level(s) of analysis:** State; Dyadic; Systemic (comparisons across techniques). 
    
- **Unit(s) of analysis:** **Influence attempts** (A seeks to change B with economic instruments). 
    
- **Dependent variable(s):** Behavioral change; altered beliefs/propensities; adjusted costs of compliance/non-compliance; audience perceptions.   
    
- **Key independent variable(s):** Instrument choice (positive/negative sanctions), credibility, difficulty, alternatives, domestic & third-party responses.   
    
- **Causal mechanism(s):** Incentives (carrots/sticks), **signaling/indices** that shape expectations; cumulative, accretive effects on capabilities and images.   
    
- **Scope conditions:** Multiple goals/targets; difficulty varies; outcomes **graded** not binary.   
    
- **Observable implications / predictions:** Expect mixed outcomes; signaling value even absent policy change; tool choice sensitive to **comparative** costs vs. alternatives.   
    
- **Potential falsifiers / disconfirming evidence:** Cases where clear, low-difficulty goals with viable alternatives see economic tools consistently underperform **after** accounting for signaling and cost-adjusted utility.

## **✅ Direct Responses to Course Questions**

  

**Q1. Setting conditions for military strategy**

**Answer:** By **shaping capabilities, incentives, and perceptions** before force; adjusting access to resources/finance, strengthening or degrading adversary capacity, and **managing images** that condition crisis behavior. Baldwin emphasizes that countries continually manage images and others’ expectations—economic measures are part of that pre-military battlespace. (pp. xiii–xv; 98–106)    ✓

  

**Q2. Supporting military strategy**

**Answer:** Economic tools **complement** force by signaling resolve (e.g., embargoes/grain cuts as “I really mean it”), **buying time**, imposing costs, and tailoring pressure on sectors/actors (positive & negative sanctions). (pp. 350–376; 103; 40–42)      ✓

  

**Q3. Avoiding conflict & communicating intentions**

**Answer:** Economic statecraft **extends the timeline**, substitutes for early military moves, and **signals intentions** more credibly than words because it **imposes costs**; Baldwin frames this as crucial to superpower crisis management. (pp. 103; 350–376)    ✓

  

**Q4. Parallel gradations to military escalation**

**Answer:** From **verbal protests → targeted licenses/tariffs → broad sectoral/financial sanctions → embargoes/cutoffs**, each step raising costs/risks akin to military **posture → shows-of-force → limited strikes → full use of force**—with economic actions often preferred for **scalable risk**. (pp. 40–42; 98–106)    ✓

  

**Q5. Constraints on military strategy**

**Answer:** Economic measures can **undermine** military options if they provoke rally effects or over-promise; yet they also **constrain war’s risks** by providing credible non-kinetic signals. Baldwin highlights judging success by **difficulty** and **comparative** options rather than binary “works/doesn’t.” (pp. xiv–xv; 118–149; 350–376)      ✓

  

**Q6. Kapstein’s Afterword & the current environment**

**Answer:** Yes. Kapstein traces a **renaissance** of economic statecraft: **targeted/financial sanctions**, great-power economic competition (e.g., **China’s BRI**), and **dollar-based leverage**—all reinforcing Baldwin’s framework while updating tools and venues. (pp. 391–396; 400–421; 431–432)      ✓

  

## **📚 Section-by-Section Notes**

  

### **Chapter 1: Introduction**

- **Purpose:** Reframe economic statecraft as **core** statecraft, not a weak sideshow.
    
- **Key claims:** Conventional wisdom underrates economic tools; the study will compare **how** to think, not **what** to decide. (pp. 1–5)
    

  

### **Chapter 2: Techniques of Statecraft**

- **Purpose:** Taxonomy—propaganda, diplomacy, **economic**, military.
    
- **Key claims:** Analyze tools **comparably**; instruments are **properties** distinct from **power bases**; compare tools because decision-makers face choices. (pp. 6–14, 21–23) 
    

  

### **Chapter 3: What Is Economic Statecraft?**

- **Purpose:** Define the **economic** and list instruments.
    
- **Key claims:** Economic statecraft = influence using resources with money prices; includes **negative** (embargo, freezing assets) and **positive** (MFN, aid, purchase) sanctions; target can be indirect. (pp. 28–33, 40–42)   
    

  

### **Chapter 4: Thinking about Economic Statecraft**

- **Purpose:** Clear analytical pitfalls.
    
- **Key claims:** Don’t treat economics as “abnormal” or apolitical; avoid **binary** success/failure; integrate with war-prevention priorities. (pp. 51–70)
    

  

### **Chapter 5: Economic Statecraft in International Thought**

- **Purpose:** Intellectual lineage (from mercantilists to liberals).
    
- **Key claims:** Competing doctrines share **means–ends** focus; economic tools are longstanding instruments of **power and order**. (pp. 71–97)
    

  

### **Chapter 6: Bargaining with Economic Statecraft**

- **Purpose:** Bargaining/signaling logic.
    
- **Key claims:** **Symbols matter**; economic moves send **credible signals** (costly, public, scalable), shape images, and can be calibrated to avoid kinetic escalation. (pp. 98–106) 
    

  

### **Chapter 7: National Power and Economic Statecraft**

- **Purpose:** Assess utility & measurement.
    
- **Key claims:** Success is **graded**; consider **difficulty** and **alternatives**; **efficiency ≠ effectiveness**. (pp. 118–136) 
    

  

### **Chapter 11: The Legality and Morality of Economic Statecraft**

- **Purpose:** Survey norms & ethics.
    
- **Key claims:** International law is **murky**; debate pits restriction vs defense of economic tools; **war-prevention priority** should guide legal reforms; **morality ≠ utility**. (pp. 350–376)     
    

  

### **Chapter 12: Conclusion**

- **Purpose:** Policy-science caution and stakes.
    
- **Key claims:** Misreading economic statecraft narrows options and can **push states toward war**; scholars should clarify alternatives for decision-makers. (pp. 390–392) 
    

  

### **Afterword (Kapstein): Economic Statecraft—Continuity & Change**

- **Purpose:** Update the toolkit & landscape.
    
- **Key claims:** Post–Cold War **targeted sanctions** surge; **financial channels** and **dollar leverage** matter; **China’s BRI** and trade politics reshape practice; the framework still fits. (pp. 391–396; 400–421; 431–432)     
    

  

## **🧩 Key Concepts & Definitions (author’s usage)**

- **Economic statecraft:** Government **influence attempts** using instruments with a market price (e.g., trade, finance, aid). 
    
- **Positive vs. Negative sanctions:** Carrots (e.g., MFN, aid) vs. sticks (e.g., embargo, asset freezes). 
    
- **Effectiveness vs. Efficiency:** Achieving outcomes vs. outcomes **at acceptable cost**; policy choice is **comparative**. 
    
- **Difficulty adjustment:** Judge outcomes against the **task’s difficulty**. 
    

  

## **🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Actors & Perspectives**

- **Sender:** Chooses economic means relative to **other tools** and costs.
    
- **Target:** Responds to **costs, benefits, and signals**; may rally or recalibrate.
    
- **Audiences/Third parties:** Interpret **images**; can amplify or offset effects. 
    

  

## **🕰 Timeline of Major Events**

- **1985** — First edition: critical rethink of sanctions “conventional wisdom.”
    
- **1990s** — Post–Cold War expansion of **UN sanctions** and **targeted measures**. 
    
- **2010s** — Rise of **financial sanctions**; **China’s BRI**, outward/inward FDI, and aid reshape practice. 
    
- **2020s** — **Dollar leverage** and institutional strain (WTO/Appellate Body) underscore continuity & change.   
    

  

## **🧠 Policy & Strategy Takeaways**

- **Do comparative math:** Choose tools by **relative utility** (effect + cost + difficulty), not “does it work?” binaries. 
    
- **Exploit signaling:** Use **costly-but-scalable** economic moves to convey resolve and **avoid premature force**. 
    
- **Design precision:** Prefer **targeted/financial** levers when broad pain risks rally effects or collateral harm. 
    
- **Legal/ethical lens:** Law is **contested**; keep **war-prevention** as the first-order criterion; morality is not reducible to utility.   
    

  

## **⚔️ Comparative Placement in the IR Canon**

- **Closest kin:** Schelling (coercion/signaling); Hirschman (power & trade interdependence).
    
- **Differs from “sanctions pessimists”:** Rejects **binary** tests and urges **cross-tool** comparisons and **difficulty** adjustments. 
    

  

## **🧐 Critical Reflections**

- **Strengths:** Clear conceptual toolkit; cross-tool comparability; emphasis on signals & alternatives.
    
- **Weaknesses / blind spots:** Less on **domestic politics** and implementation constraints by design (flagged by the author).
    
- **What would change your mind?** Systematic evidence that, after cost/difficulty controls and signaling effects, economic tools still **underperform** direct military/diplomatic options in comparable cases.
    

  

## **❓ Open Questions for Seminar**

- When do **positive** incentives outperform **negative** sanctions for signaling?
    
- How do **financial networks** and **currency dominance** alter escalation ladders?
    

  

## **✍️ Notable Quotes (with pages)**

- _“Success is a matter of degree… Foreign policy undertakings rarely completely succeed or completely fail.”_ (p. xiv) 
    
- _“Efficiency takes into account both effectiveness and the costs… judgments based solely on effectiveness can be highly misleading.”_ (p. xiv) 
    

  

## **📝 Exam Drills**

- **Likely prompt:** “Explain how Baldwin’s framework guides the choice between economic and military instruments in crisis bargaining.”
    
    **Skeleton answer:**
    
    1. **Define the problem & goals/targets** (multi-goal, multi-audience). 
        
    2. **Compare tools by efficiency** (effectiveness + cost + difficulty; signaling value).   
        
    3. **Select scalable economic moves** to **communicate resolve** and **buy time** while holding military options in reserve; justify within **legal/ethical** war-prevention priority.
