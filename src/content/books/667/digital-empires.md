# Digital Empires

_The Global Battle to Regulate Technology_

## 🎙️ Comps Prep (Oral Comprehensive Exam)

- If the US, China, and the EU can export “tech companies, technologies, and rules” beyond their borders, then global competition increasingly runs through “digital empires,” because influence comes from governing foreign populations’ data/information without formal conquest. So what for strategy: treat tech governance as geopolitical terrain, not “domestic policy.” (PDF p. 13)
    
- When a state chooses a market-driven, state-driven, or rights-driven regulatory model, then it gets predictable tradeoffs in innovation, control, and rights—and exports those tradeoffs abroad—because each model reflects distinct ideological commitments embedded in law and institutions. So what for strategy: partner alignment will often hinge on regulatory values, not just hardware. (PDF p. 13)
    
- When horizontal rivalry among empires intersects with vertical struggle between governments and tech firms, then platforms become both instruments and obstacles to state power, because states need private capability (innovation/cybersecurity) while trying to curb corporate governance over societies. So what for strategy: plan for firms as semi-sovereign actors in competition, not neutral vendors. (PDF p. 33)
    
- Bridge: This aligns with Patterson’s strategic-competition framing of IW-by-other-means by showing regulation/standards/data rules as non-kinetic levers that can decide “the battle for the soul of the digital economy.” (PDF p. 33)
    

## Online Description

Bradford argues that the US, China, and the EU function as three “digital empires,” each advancing a distinct regulatory model—market-driven, state-driven, and rights-driven—while exporting that model through corporate dominance, infrastructure buildout, and regulatory reach. These competing approaches collide in battles over technology, markets, security, and rights, reshaping global power and raising high-stakes questions about the future of liberal democracy and the global digital order. (PDF p. 13, PDF p. 30–33)

## Author Background

TBD

---

## 60‑Second Brief

- Core claim (1–2 sentences):
    
    - The US, China, and EU are competing “digital empires” whose regulatory models travel across borders through firms, infrastructure, and law—reordering global power around control of data/information and the rules of the digital economy. (PDF p. 13, PDF p. 29)
        
- Causal logic in a phrase:
    
    - **Regulatory model → export mechanism (private / infrastructure / regulatory power) → global standards & dependencies → durable influence over foreign societies.** (PDF p. 29)
        
- Why it matters for IW / strategic competition (2–4 bullets):
    
    - Regulation and standards become tools of coercion, alignment, and influence below armed conflict thresholds—shaping how populations communicate, organize, and perceive legitimacy. (PDF p. 13)
        
    - “Horizontal” rivalry among empires and “vertical” rivalry between states and tech firms turns platforms/infrastructure into contested terrain. (PDF p. 33)
        
    - Model diffusion (and backlash) creates bloc-like dynamics (rights vs control vs markets), raising risks of fragmentation and competitive escalation. (PDF p. 30–33)
        
- Best single takeaway (1 sentence):
    
    - Strategy in the 2020s requires treating tech regulation, data governance, and infrastructure choices as grand-strategic decisions, not administrative details. (PDF p. 13, PDF p. 29–33)
        

## Course Lens

- How does this text define/illuminate **irregular warfare**?
    
    - Not an IW text per se, but it reframes “competition” as governance over populations via control of data/information and the digital rules that structure daily life—an influence contest that operates persistently “below war.” (PDF p. 13)
        
    - It highlights how states (and firms) can shape foreign societies without formal political control—an “informal empire” logic relevant to modern influence campaigns and political warfare. (PDF p. 13)
        
- What does it imply about **power/control**, **success metrics**, and **timeline** in IW?
    
    - Power is exercised through rule-setting and system design: **private power** (dominant firms), **infrastructure power** (networks/standards), and **regulatory power** (laws with extraterritorial effects). (PDF p. 29)
        
    - Control is both **horizontal** (empire vs empire) and **vertical** (state vs platform); success is durable compliance, dependency, and norm adoption—not battlefield outcomes. (PDF p. 33)
        
    - Timeline is long: infrastructure and regulatory diffusion create path dependencies that are hard to unwind once embedded in foreign societies. (PDF p. 13, PDF p. 29)
        
- How does it connect to **strategic competition**?
    
    - Regulation functions as geopolitical strategy by externalizing a model’s values (freedom/market, control/state, rights/law) into other jurisdictions and shaping global standards—deciding whose rules govern the digital order. (PDF p. 13, PDF p. 30–33)

## ✅ Direct Responses to Seminar Questions

- **Q:** How do the three digital empires reshape global competition?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - They reframe competition as a struggle over **governance of the digital economy**—who sets the rules that shape foreign societies—rather than only territorial or military contests. (PDF p. 13)
            
        - Each empire projects influence by exporting a domestic model abroad, pulling other states “into the orbits” of competing regulatory regimes. (PDF p. 13)
            
        - Competition becomes multi-channel: **private power** (US firms), **infrastructure power** (China’s network buildout), and **regulatory power** (EU rule-setting) operate as distinct vectors of influence. (PDF p. 29)
            
        - Rivalry is not only interstate (“horizontal” battles) but also state–platform (“vertical” battles) that determine whether governments or firms govern key social spaces. (PDF p. 33)
            
        - Unaligned markets become “battlefields,” where local governments weigh American platforms, Chinese infrastructure, and European law when choosing digital futures. (PDF p. 29)
            
- **Q:** How does regulation operate as geopolitical strategy?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - Regulation exports values and constraints: by pushing a model abroad, states seek to “shift the rest of the world closer to the norms and values inherent in their … models.” (PDF p. 26)
            
        - The EU’s strategy relies heavily on **regulatory power** that “entrenches European digital norms across the global marketplace,” affecting non-EU users through corporate compliance. (PDF p. 29)
            
        - China’s strategy relies heavily on **infrastructure power**, building “critical digital network infrastructures” abroad via firms with close state ties, embedding standards and dependencies. (PDF p. 29)
            
        - The US strategy historically relied heavily on **private power**—dominant companies shaping the global digital sphere through products/services and business practices. (PDF p. 29)
            
        - Regulation also becomes coercive statecraft in the tech war context—e.g., export controls and entity listings used to constrain adversary capabilities and shape the technological frontier. (PDF p. 217–218)
            
- **Q:** What implications arise from divergent standards?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - Divergent standards intensify “battle lines” where models collide—especially around speech/content, privacy/data flows, and security—making interoperability and shared governance harder. (PDF p. 33–35)
            
        - Firms face conflicting compliance demands, pushing them toward market exits, localization, or selective compliance—fueling fragmentation dynamics. (PDF p. 33, PDF p. 206)
            
        - Divergence heightens alliance management problems: democracies must reconcile different balances of rights, markets, and security to avoid being out-competed by the coherence of authoritarian control models. (PDF p. 30–33)
            
        - Divergent regimes amplify national security anxieties: data access, espionage risk, and supply-chain leverage become central, not peripheral, to tech policy. (PDF p. 28–29)
            
        - The information environment becomes a strategic battleground: standards shape what populations see, share, and trust—raising stakes for legitimacy and democratic resilience. (PDF p. 33, PDF p. 449)
            
- **Q:** Which model is best positioned for future competition?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - Bradford argues the conventional US–China binary is “flawed,” because the EU constitutes a third center of regulatory gravity shaping the future digital order. (PDF p. 30)
            
        - She argues the “American market-driven regulatory model is fading,” leaving many countries to coalesce behind either a Chinese state-driven variant or core tenets of the European rights-driven model. (PDF p. 30)
            
        - The EU is described as “a more desirable alternative model in the democratic world,” while China’s model is “appealing to authoritarian leaders” and some developing countries. (PDF p. 31)
            
        - Practical “positioning” therefore looks bifurcated: the EU can lead in rule-setting diffusion; China can expand via infrastructure/standards and offer an authoritarian toolkit; the US retains private power but faces declining model legitimacy absent regulatory adaptation. (PDF p. 29–31)
            
- **Q:** Does the US reliance on private-sector innovation strengthen or weaken national security when compared to the EU and Chinese regulatory models?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - It strengthens national power through the global dominance of US tech firms (private power), but creates governance gaps when market incentives conflict with societal resilience, privacy, and democratic integrity. (PDF p. 29, PDF p. 26)
            
        - The US model’s “limited role for the government” is explicitly bounded by national security/cybersecurity where the state “can and must work alongside private companies”—suggesting security dependence on private capability. (PDF p. 33)
            
        - China’s state-driven model can align firms with regime objectives and security priorities (and control information flows), but at the cost of rights and openness—turning technology into a tool to “empower the state, not its people.” (PDF p. 33)
            
        - The EU’s rights-driven model prioritizes protections that can bolster democratic resilience and trust (privacy, constraints on harmful content and market power), but can be portrayed as harming innovation and free speech—raising tradeoff questions in competition. (PDF p. 28–29)
            
        - Bradford’s framing implies national security is not just “capability,” but also legitimacy and governance: democracies can lose if they lose either to China (horizontal) or to tech giants (vertical). (PDF p. 33)
            
- **Q:** What does Bradford’s work reveal about the strategic significance of data?
    
    - **A:**
        
        - Data is the central resource of digital power: “personal data is the most valuable resource in the 21st-century digital economy” and fuels tech firms’ power—making data governance core to national influence. (PDF p. 11)
            
        - Data flows become a geopolitical fault line: EU privacy constraints and US surveillance practices can disrupt transatlantic commerce and force firms to reconsider market presence. (PDF p. 29, PDF p. 261–263)
            
        - Data access and control underpin both vertical battles (states vs firms) and horizontal rivalry (empire vs empire), linking domestic legal regimes to global alignment choices. (PDF p. 33)
            
        - In authoritarian contexts, data enables surveillance, censorship, and behavioral manipulation, making exported infrastructure and standards strategically consequential (control at scale). (PDF p. 102–103, PDF p. 38)

## Chapter-by-Chapter Breakdown

### Chapter 0: Introduction (PDF p. 7–39)

- **One-sentence thesis:** Bradford frames the US, China, and the EU as three competing “digital empires” whose export of firms, infrastructure, and rules reshapes global power through control of data/information and governance beyond borders. (PDF p. 13)
    
- **What happens / what the author argues (5–10 bullets):**
    
    - Starts from mounting calls to regulate tech (including AI risks) but highlights that consensus on _need_ for regulation doesn’t imply consensus on _form_ of regulation. (PDF p. 13)
        
    - Defines three “dominant digital powers” (US, China, EU) as “digital empires,” analogous to informal empires projecting power across borders. (PDF p. 13)
        
    - Argues digital power is centered on controlling data/information; “control of data and information is power.” (PDF p. 13)
        
    - Introduces export logic: empires extend governance models abroad, influencing foreign societies without seeking formal political control. (PDF p. 13)
        
    - Distinguishes **private**, **infrastructure**, and **regulatory** power—and maps each to US, China, EU respectively. (PDF p. 29)
        
    - Frames competition as both **horizontal** (empire vs empire) and **vertical** (governments vs tech companies). (PDF p. 33)

### Chapter 1: The American Market-Driven Regulatory Model (PDF p. 41–81)

- **One-sentence thesis:** The US model prioritizes free speech, a “free internet,” and innovation by limiting state regulation and relying on markets and self-regulation—except where national security/cybersecurity justify state involvement. (PDF p. 33)
    
- **What happens / what the author argues (5–10 bullets):**
    
    - Describes an American regulatory ethos that places “notable faith in markets” and a limited governmental role to preserve innovation. (PDF p. 33)
        
    - Shows how liability and speech frameworks create broad operating space for platforms, reinforcing market-led governance. (PDF p. 49–54)

    - Stratton Oakmont v Prodigy (platform moderation liability context) (PDF p. 49)
        
- **IW / strategy relevance (2–4 bullets):**
    
    - US private power (platform reach) is a strategic asset—but also a vulnerability if governance gaps enable adversary influence operations. (PDF p. 29, PDF p. 33)
        
    - Illustrates how domestic legal design choices can produce global influence through platform diffusion.
        
    - Highlights security dependence on private capability: the state must “work alongside” firms in cybersecurity. (PDF p. 33)
        
- **Links to seminar questions:** Q1, Q2, Q5, Q6
    
- **Notable quotes (0–2):**
    
    - “unfettered by Federal or State regulation.” (PDF p. 54)
        

### Chapter 2: The Chinese State-Driven Regulatory Model (PDF p. 82–122)

- **One-sentence thesis:** China’s state-driven model harnesses technology for economic growth and regime security, embedding censorship and surveillance into governance while subordinating tech firms to CCP control. (PDF p. 82–83)
    
- **What happens / what the author argues (5–10 bullets):**
    
    - Opens with Xi-era intensification of information control: a renewed crackdown on the internet and digital political space. (PDF p. 82)
        
    - Frames online space as a regime battleground for public opinion and stability. (PDF p. 82)

    - Shows how surveillance scales through data collection and AI-enabled monitoring, including facial recognition and social management systems. (PDF p. 102–103)
        
    - Connects state control to industrial strategy: tech is treated as a national project, not merely market competition. (PDF p. 92)
        
    - Highlights “crackdown” dynamics aimed at ensuring tech giants do not “overpower the Chinese state,” including interventions in major firms. (PDF p. 13, PDF p. 110)

- **What happens / what the author argues (5–10 bullets):**
    
    - Positions EU regulation as a deliberate alternative to both US market-led governance and Chinese state control. (PDF p. 33)
        
    - Treats data protection and privacy as foundational constraints shaping digital markets and platform behavior. (PDF p. 123)
        
    - Describes how the EU targets harmful online content and disinformation as threats to democracy, not just consumer issues. (PDF p. 134–138)
        
    - Highlights legislative tools aimed at platform accountability and systemic risk mitigation (e.g., DSA proposals). (PDF p. 137–138)
        
    - Frames EU activism as reclaiming control over tech giants via antitrust and data protection enforcement. (PDF p. 13)

**Part II Summary (Imperial Rivalries):**

- Moves from model description to collision points where regimes and firms confront incompatibilities across speech, data, and security. (PDF p. 33–35)
    
- Demonstrates how firms “straddle” models and become the object of vertical battles, while states contest each other horizontally in the same domains. (PDF p. 34)
    
- Shows how these clashes harden bloc dynamics and raise the stakes of standard-setting and supply chain dependence. (PDF p. 35)
    

### Chapter 4: Between Freedom and Control: Navigating Competing Regulatory Models (PDF p. 170–208)

- **One-sentence thesis:** As tech firms operate across empires, they are forced to mediate incompatible demands between openness and control, turning corporate decisions (compliance, exit, localization) into geopolitical acts that shape fragmentation and influence. (PDF p. 34, PDF p. 206)
    
- **What happens / what the author argues (5–10 bullets):**
    
    - Focuses on firms caught “between” models as they confront competing rules and values in multiple jurisdictions. (PDF p. 34)
        
    - Highlights vertical battles: governments pressure firms to align with national priorities, while firms resist to protect business models and global access. (PDF p. 34)
        
    - Explores dilemmas for American firms operating in China under censorship and data control pressures. (PDF p. 178–179)
        
    - Examines Chinese firms abroad facing democratic scrutiny, including national security concerns tied to data access and influence. (PDF p. 191)
        
    - Shows how disputes drive talk (and policy movement) toward decoupling, localization, and fractured governance.
        
    - Frames platform governance and app ecosystems as spaces where values get enforced de facto, not just debated.
        
- **Key concepts introduced (0–5):**
    
    - Corporate “straddling” of models (PDF p. 34)

- Mechanism(s):
    
    - **Private power diffusion**: global platform dominance exports norms/business practices (PDF p. 29, PDF p. 293)
        
    - **Infrastructure embedding**: building networks + standards exports governance preferences (PDF p. 29, PDF p. 38)
        
    - **Regulatory diffusion (“Brussels Effect”)**: de facto corporate standardization and de jure legal emulation (PDF p. 371–372)

- Scope conditions / where it should NOT apply:
    
    - Less applicable where states lack regulatory/enforcement capacity or where digital markets are insulated from cross-border firms/infrastructure (inference).
        
    - Model diffusion may be constrained by domestic politics, developmental capacity, and security alignments (inference).
        
- Observable implications / predictions:

## Key Arguments & Evidence

- Argument 1: Digital geopolitics is now a three-empire contest, not a simple US–China binary.
    
    - Evidence/examples:
        
        - Three “digital empires” with distinct models (PDF p. 13)
            
        - The US–China binary is “flawed” because EU model shapes choices and standards (PDF p. 30)
            
    - So what:
        
        - Strategic competition requires coalition strategy around standards and governance, not only tech breakthroughs.
            
- Argument 2: The mechanism of influence differs—private vs infrastructure vs regulatory power—and each creates different dependencies.
    
    - Evidence/examples:
        
        - US private power, China infrastructure power, EU regulatory power (PDF p. 29)
            
        - Infrastructure export via Digital Silk Road + standards leadership (PDF p. 38)
            
        - Brussels Effect diffusion (PDF p. 371–372)
            
    - So what:
        
        - Competing with China or leveraging EU influence requires tailored tools (financing, standard-setting, enforcement coordination).
            
- Argument 3: The core conflict is both horizontal (empire vs empire) and vertical (state vs tech firm), and losing either can undermine democracy.
    
    - Evidence/examples:
        
        - Horizontal/vertical battle framing (PDF p. 33)
            
        - Risk of state-driven global shift vs risk of tech giants governing societies through business models (PDF p. 33)
            
    - So what:
        
        - Strategy must integrate domestic regulation, alliance policy, and corporate governance as parts of a single competition.
            
- Argument 4: The US market-driven model is losing legitimacy, pushing many states toward EU rights rules or China control tools.
    
    - Evidence/examples:
        
        - “American market-driven regulatory model is fading” (PDF p. 30)
            
        - Global backlash linked to harmful practices and outsized influence of US tech (PDF p. 37)
            
    - So what:
        
        - US grand strategy must decide whether to converge with EU democratic regulation or risk ceding governance leadership to China.
            

## ⚖️ Assumptions & Critical Tensions

- Assumptions the author needs:
    
    - Regulatory models are coherent enough to classify and to generate predictable externalities across borders. (PDF p. 33)
        
    - States (or supranational entities) can effectively enforce rules on powerful platforms and infrastructures (challenged by “vertical battle” constraints). (PDF p. 33)
        
- Tensions / tradeoffs / contradictions:
    
    - Rights-protecting regulation can be framed as “regulatory imperialism” or innovation constraint, yet can also protect global users and democracy. (PDF p. 28–29)
        
    - Infrastructure export can be welcomed as development and sovereignty while simultaneously increasing surveillance capacity and geopolitical dependence. (PDF p. 38)
        
    - Democracies face dual risk: authoritarian model diffusion (horizontal loss) vs corporate governance dominance (vertical loss). (PDF p. 33)
        
- What would change the author’s mind? (mark clearly as inference)
    
    - **Inference:** If the US could credibly reform toward a widely emulated democratic regulatory model while retaining innovation leadership, the “fading” trajectory could reverse. (anchored to fading claim) (PDF p. 30)
        

## Critique Points

- Strongest critique:
    
    - The “three-model” frame can compress internal variation and hybridization within each empire (e.g., overlapping commitments and evolution) into ideal types, risking over-clarity. (PDF p. 33)
        
- Weakest critique:
    
    - The book anticipates restraint via interdependence, but the balance between interdependence and hardening bloc politics can shift quickly under shocks (inference).
        
- Method/data critique (if applicable):
    
    - Largely a synthetic, cross-domain governance analysis; causal attribution for model diffusion may be difficult to isolate from broader political economy drivers (inference).
        
- Missing variable / alternative explanation:
    
    - Domestic political coalitions and economic structure in third countries may explain model adoption as much as “empire” pull—especially where leaders use regulation for internal legitimacy (inference).

## Policy & Strategy Takeaways

- Implications for the US + partners:
    
    - Treat tech governance as alliance politics: democratic coalitions need shared baselines on privacy, platform accountability, and AI governance to avoid ceding the field to coherent authoritarian offers. (PDF p. 30–33)
        
    - Compete on infrastructure: provide credible alternatives to Digital Silk Road financing and vendor ecosystems to reduce dependency and surveillance externalities. (PDF p. 38)
        
    - Harmonize security with rights: US surveillance practices can undermine transatlantic data governance and weaken coalition cohesion. (PDF p. 29, PDF p. 261–263)
        
- Practical “do this / avoid that” bullets:
    
    - Do build coordinated standards strategies across democracies (regulation + technical standards + procurement).
        
    - Do align export-control strategy with allies to avoid leakage and reduce partner resentment while preserving chokepoints. (PDF p. 217–220)
        
    - Avoid treating tech policy as purely economic policy; it has direct implications for legitimacy, influence, and domestic resilience. (PDF p. 13, PDF p. 33)
        
- Risks / second-order effects:
    
    - Overuse of coercive tools (export controls, market exclusions) can accelerate fragmentation and push third countries into rival or “non-aligned” stacks. (PDF p. 220)
        
    - Democratic overregulation without innovation strategy can erode competitiveness, creating security dependence on non-democratic tech stacks (inference).
        
    - Infrastructure competition can be interpreted as neo-imperial rivalry, increasing political backlash (inference).
        
- What to measure (MOE/MOP ideas) and over what timeline:
    
    - Adoption of EU-like privacy/platform statutes (de jure diffusion) over 3–10 years. (PDF p. 371–372)
        
    - Corporate global compliance convergence (de facto diffusion) over 1–5 years. (PDF p. 371–372)
        
    - Infrastructure vendor concentration and standards-body leadership shares over 5–15 years. (PDF p. 38)
        
    - Indicators of democratic resilience: election integrity impacts, disinformation prevalence, and platform systemic risk responses over 1–4 years. (PDF p. 33)
        

## ⚔️ Cross‑Text Synthesis (SAASS 644)

- Where this aligns:
    
    - Aligns with strategic-competition framings that treat influence, legitimacy, and governance as decisive terrain—here, via regulation, standards, and data rules rather than kinetic force. (PDF p. 13, PDF p. 33)
        
- Where this contradicts:
    
    - It complicates purely state-centric competition stories by emphasizing vertical battles where tech giants can constrain states and shape societies across borders. (PDF p. 33)
        
- What it adds that others miss:
    
    - A concrete typology of **power mechanisms** (private / infrastructure / regulatory) that lets strategists distinguish “how influence travels” in the digital domain. (PDF p. 29)
        
- 2–4 “bridge” insights tying at least TWO other readings together:
    
    - Bradford + **Kalyvas**: if control and information are central to political violence, then digital platforms/infrastructure are the modern “control” substrate—rule-setting over information flows becomes a proxy for territorial control. (PDF p. 13, PDF p. 33)
        
    - Bradford + **German**: “nontraditional means” of competition map well onto regulatory and standards warfare—states can coerce and shape others through laws and technical architectures without firing shots. (PDF p. 29, PDF p. 371–372)
        
    - Bradford + **Patterson**: strategic competition in IW is partly about shaping how societies govern themselves; here, regulation/data governance decides whose values structure daily life, creating durable alignment. (PDF p. 30–33)
        
    - Bradford + **Biddle**: institutions and governance capacity matter—regulatory enforcement and state–society constraints shape whether democracies can compete without adopting authoritarian control methods. (PDF p. 33)

## Exam Drills / Take‑Home Hooks

- Prompt 1: _“Explain how regulation operates as geopolitical strategy in the global digital economy.”_
    
    - Outline (3 parts):
        
        1. Define digital empires + mechanisms of power (private / infrastructure / regulatory). (PDF p. 13, PDF p. 29)
            
        2. Show how rules travel (Brussels Effect; infrastructure export; platform diffusion) and why that creates dependence/influence. (PDF p. 38, PDF p. 371–372)
            
        3. Assess strategic implications: alignment choices, fragmentation risks, and democratic resilience stakes. (PDF p. 30–33)
            
- Prompt 2: _“Which digital empire is best positioned to shape the future global order—and why?”_
    
    - Outline (3 parts):
        
        1. Reject US–China binary; include EU as third pole. (PDF p. 30)
            
        2. Compare diffusion channels: US private power vs China infrastructure vs EU regulatory (plus strengths/limits). (PDF p. 29–31)
            
        3. Conclude with conditional forecast: EU among democracies; China among authoritarians/developing recipients; US depends on regulatory adaptation. (PDF p. 30–31, PDF p. 38)
            
- Prompt 3: _“Assess the national security tradeoffs of the US market-driven model.”_
    
    - Outline (3 parts):
        
        1. Innovation + private power as strategic asset (platform dominance). (PDF p. 29)
            
        2. Governance gaps as vulnerability (vertical battle; democratic integrity risks). (PDF p. 33)
            
        3. Strategy options: align with EU democratic regulation; counter China infrastructure influence; manage export controls without self-fragmentation. (PDF p. 30–33, PDF p. 38)
            
- If I had to write a 1500‑word response in 4–5 hours, my thesis would be:
    
    - **Bradford shows that tech regulation is now a primary arena of strategic competition: power flows through exported rules, infrastructures, and platforms, and democracies must coordinate to avoid losing either to China’s state control or to tech giants’ private governance.** (PDF p. 13, PDF p. 33)
        
- 3 supporting points + 1 anticipated counterargument:
    
    - Support 1: Three mechanisms (private / infrastructure / regulatory power) explain how influence travels globally. (PDF p. 29)
        
    - Support 2: The US model is “fading,” making EU vs China the principal choice architecture for many states. (PDF p. 30–31)
        
    - Support 3: Horizontal and vertical battles jointly determine democratic resilience; losing either undermines liberal democracy. (PDF p. 33)
        
    - Counterargument: Interdependence and hybridization may prevent stark outcomes and sustain a messy, mixed global order rather than bloc consolidation (inference).
