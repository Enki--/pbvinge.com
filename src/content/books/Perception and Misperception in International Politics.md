## Reading Questions

 - How do humans perceive social phenomena?
	 - Humans use a process of pattern matching and fit selection to determine which structure best fits what they are processing, and then they apply the stereotypes associated with the structure to the target. 
	 
 - How do you explain the concept of cognitive consistency?
	 - Cognitive consistency is the idea that humans seek information that aligns with their beliefs because a lack of alignment causes cognitive dissonance.  
	 
 - How do decision makers learn from history?
	 - Decision Makers learn from history by generating or updating their mental structures when events happen, so they can pattern match and reapply the learning in future events.  This concept is similar to that presented in [Analogies at War](https://pbvinge.com/books/analogies-at-war/).  The caution is that humans must apply the correct structure/analogy, or we will misinterpret the situation. 
 
 - What is cognitive dissonance?
	 - Cognitive dissonance is what happens when people hold a belief and information that contradict one another.  On one hand, this can be viewed as non-rational/wishful thinking, on the other, it leads to one of my favorite quotes.  "The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function."
	 - 
 - How might we minimize misperceptions in strategic discourse?
	 - To minimize misperception, we must always be thinking about the common ways we are misperceived (wrong analogy, bias, etc), and attempt to question our assumptions.  
	 
 - Can we really improve our understanding of others by paying more attention to perceptions (ours AND theirs)?
	 - Yes, a million books on this topic.  The goal of communication is to convey an idea to effectively do this, we must be able to predict how the receiver will understand our message to some degree. 

## Online Description

With a new preface by the author, since its original publication in 1976, Perception and Misperception in International Politics has become a landmark book in its field, hailed by the New York Times as "the seminal statement of principles underlying political psychology." This new edition includes an extensive preface by the author reflecting on the book's lasting impact and legacy, particularly in the application of cognitive psychology to political decision making, and brings that analysis up to date by discussing the relevant psychological research over the past forty years. Jervis describes the process of perception (for example, how decision makers learn from history) and then explores common forms of misperception (such as overestimating one's influence). He then tests his ideas through a number of important events in international relations from nineteenth- and twentieth-century European history. Perception and Misperception in International Politics is essential for understanding international relations today.

  

## üî´ Author Background

Robert Jervis was a prominent American political scientist and a leading figure in the field of international relations, particularly known for applying psychological insights to the study of foreign policy. Educated at Oberlin College and the University of California, Berkeley, he was heavily influenced by the Cold War context in which he came of age‚Äîan era marked by high-stakes diplomacy, nuclear deterrence, and frequent miscalculations between superpowers. Jervis‚Äôs interest in how leaders perceive threats and interpret ambiguous signals stemmed from a deep concern about the recurring failures of deterrence and the ease with which states misjudge one another. His background in psychology, particularly cognitive theory, shaped his approach to understanding decision-making not as purely rational but as systematically biased. The Vietnam War and the Cuban Missile Crisis also left a lasting impact on his thinking, reinforcing the dangers of faulty assumptions in high-stakes politics. At Columbia University, where he taught for decades, Jervis built a body of work that challenged traditional realist notions by emphasizing the human and perceptual dimensions of international politics. _Perception and Misperception in International Politics_ remains one of his most influential works, bridging the gap between psychological theory and strategic analysis.
  

## üîç Author's Main Issue / Thesis

- Robert Jervis argues that misperception‚Äîshaped by cognitive biases, prior beliefs, and psychological tendencies‚Äîis a fundamental driver of international conflict and misunderstanding. His central thesis is that state leaders often interpret ambiguous or conflicting information in ways that reinforce their existing views, leading to systematic errors in foreign policy decision-making.


## üìí Sections

## üìñ Chapter 1: Perception and the Level of Analysis Problem

### Identified Thesis
Perceptions matter fundamentally to international politics; to understand why states act as they do, we must analyze how decision-makers perceive situations, not just the external environment.

### Author‚Äôs Central Question
Do perceptions matter enough to merit systematic study, beyond structural or interest-based explanations?

### Key Premises & Supporting Points
- Distinguishes between the **‚Äúpsychological milieu‚Äù** (the world as perceived) and the **‚Äúoperational milieu‚Äù** (objective external world).
- Argues we cannot explain the "why" behind state behavior (not just "what happened") without examining decision-making processes and perceptions.
- Pushes back against approaches that ignore intervening variables like beliefs or perceptions in favor of purely systemic or materialist analyses.

### Key Assumptions
- That perceptions diverge systematically from objective reality in ways that shape outcomes.

### Potential Critique
- Early on, Jervis acknowledges that multiple factors shape decisions ‚Äî perceptions aren‚Äôt everything ‚Äî but he downplays how structural incentives might override perceptions in some scenarios.

## üìñ Chapter 2: Perception and the Misperception of Intentions

### Identified Thesis
Decision-makers use past behavior and inferred intentions to predict future actions, but these inferences are systematically prone to error.

### Central Question
How do states infer intentions from past actions, and what rules or heuristics guide these inferences?

### Key Premises
- Offers a framework for how observers deduce intentions: weighing consistency of behavior, costs incurred by the other side, context, etc.
- Highlights that perceptions of intentions are slippery and easily distorted, especially under uncertainty.

### Main Supporting Evidence
- Draws on examples like appeasement and deterrence failures where misreading intentions led to catastrophic miscalculations.

### Critique Point
- Some assumptions about how observers process evidence could benefit from more direct psychological experiments.

---

## üìñ Chapter 3: The Spiral and Deterrence Models

### Identified Thesis
Much debate over deterrence vs. appeasement boils down to differing perceptions of the adversary‚Äôs nature and intentions. Misperception plays a critical role in both theories.

### Central Question
Why do policymakers disagree so sharply about applying deterrence or spiral models, and how does perception shape these choices?

### Key Premises
- Shows how disagreements in theory (e.g. Kennan vs. hardliners) often arise from different beliefs about the other‚Äôs intentions ‚Äî is the adversary aggressive or insecure?
- Analyzes why evidence is ambiguous enough to support competing interpretations.

### Main Supporting Evidence
- Examples from [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War) debates, like perceptions of the USSR‚Äôs risk tolerance and goals.

### Critique
- Could engage more systematically with alternative explanations like domestic politics.

---

## üìñ Chapter 4: Cognitive Consistency and the Interaction Between Theory and Data

### Identified Thesis
People seek cognitive consistency, often assimilating new evidence into pre-existing beliefs rather than updating beliefs. This process is key to understanding persistent misperceptions in international politics.

### Central Question
How do psychological needs for coherence shape the way decision-makers process new information?

### Key Premises
- Differentiates between rational consistency (logical coherence) and irrational consistency (clinging to beliefs despite contradictory data).
- Highlights mechanisms: assimilation of data, premature cognitive closure, avoidance of value trade-offs.

### Main Supporting Evidence
- Draws on cognitive [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology) (balance theory, categorization) and applies to cases like perceptions of Soviet intentions.

### Identified Assumptions
- Assumes people value consistency over accuracy under ambiguity.

### Critique
- Limited empirical testing in actual high-stakes political contexts.

---

## üìñ Chapter 5: The Impact of the Evoked Set

### Identified Thesis
Immediate concerns (the ‚Äúevoked set‚Äù) strongly shape what decision-makers notice and how they interpret ambiguous data, often more than deep-seated beliefs.

### Central Question
Why do decision-makers fixate on certain interpretations of new events?

### Key Premises
- Illustrates with psychological experiments: people see what they expect or are currently concerned with (faces vs. goblet illusions).
- Shows how leaders misinterpret situations by assuming others share their priorities (e.g. Anglo-American misunderstandings over Suez, cockpit errors in the Libyan airliner incident).

### Main Supporting Evidence
- Historical misinterpretations driven by different immediate concerns ‚Äî e.g. Eden vs. Dulles during Suez.

### Critique
- Less about systematic bias and more about situational blindness ‚Äî a subtlety that Jervis could develop more fully.

## üìñ Chapter 6: How Decision-Makers Learn from History

### Identified Thesis
Decision-makers use history‚Äîoften selectively interpreted‚Äîto form predispositions that shape how they perceive current international situations.

### Author‚Äôs Central Question
How does historical experience (both direct and indirect) shape perceptions and policy choices in international politics?

### Key Premises & Supporting Points
- People draw lessons that fit pre-existing views more than they revise beliefs from objective learning.
- Firsthand experiences, ‚Äúthe last war,‚Äù and key domestic events disproportionately shape elite worldviews.
- Organizational experiences also shape learning, but lessons may be outdated or inapplicable.

### Main Evidence
- Shows how revolutions or wars influence perceptions long after objective conditions change (e.g., US views post-Vietnam).

### Critique
- Jervis acknowledges alternative explanations (like domestic politics), which strengthens his argument.

---

## üìñ Chapter 7: Attitude Change

### Identified Thesis
Although beliefs and images appear stable, new discrepant information can change attitudes under certain conditions.

### Central Question
What psychological mechanisms govern how and when decision-makers change deeply held beliefs?

### Key Premises
- Central beliefs resist change more than peripheral ones.
- Change often happens not when single disconfirming facts appear, but when the weight of new evidence becomes undeniable.
- The rate at which information arrives also matters ‚Äî slow accumulation has less effect.

### Evidence & Examples
- Draws on attitude change literature from social psychology, applying to decision-makers‚Äô beliefs about adversaries.

### Critique
- Recognizes that even strong new evidence may not immediately overturn prior beliefs due to cognitive inertia.

---

## üìñ Chapter 8: Perceptions of Centralization

### Identified Thesis
Actors systematically overestimate the centralization, unity, and planning behind the behavior of other states.

### Central Question
Why do policymakers assume adversaries act as a coordinated whole, and what misperceptions does this create?

### Key Premises
- Cognitive drive to impose order leads people to see conspiracies or centralized plans where there may be fragmented, competing actors.
- This also means random or accidental events get woven into coherent but misleading stories.

### Evidence
- Examples from misinterpretations of Soviet policy or over-attribution of agency in foreign governments.

### Critique
- Overemphasis on psychological explanation could underplay real institutional hierarchies in some regimes.

---

## üìñ Chapter 9: Overestimating One‚Äôs Importance as Influence or Target

### Identified Thesis
States often overestimate how much they influence others and how much they are targeted by others, misunderstanding the autonomy of the other side‚Äôs concerns.

### Central Question
How do states exaggerate their own role in others‚Äô calculations, either as influencers or targets?

### Key Premises
- Decision-makers assume their signals are understood and that their policies have more direct impact than they often do.
- Failing to see that the other side‚Äôs actions are shaped by its own internal constraints and priorities.

### Evidence
- Historical misunderstandings (like US assumptions that Russia focused on Germany the same way Britain did after 1917) illustrate how each side projects its priorities onto the other.

### Critique
- Highlights under-appreciated psychological bias that can escalate tensions when actions are misread as deliberate responses.

---

## üìñ Chapter 10: The Influence of Desires and Fears on Perceptions

### Identified Thesis
Desires and fears shape perceptions through mechanisms like wishful thinking and threat exaggeration ‚Äî often in complex, sometimes contradictory ways.

### Central Question
How do affective states (hopes and fears) distort the perception of international realities?

### Key Premises
- Psychological experiments show desires can inflate probability judgments (wishful thinking), but under threat, people often also overestimate dangers (fear-based vigilance).
- Different circumstances trigger these divergent biases.

### Evidence
- Jervis surveys experiments manipulating affect and applies them to IR, discussing cases like misreading adversary signals under fear.

### Critique
- Notes that the evidence is mixed and correlations modest, calling for cautious interpretation.

# üìö Chapters 11‚Äì12 Structured Notes

## üìñ Chapter 11: Cognitive Dissonance and [international relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations)

### Identified Thesis
The psychological theory of cognitive dissonance helps explain why policymakers distort or ignore inconvenient information, reinforcing mistaken beliefs and leading to path-dependent errors in foreign policy.

### Author‚Äôs Central Question
How does the drive to reduce internal psychological discomfort (dissonance) cause decision-makers to misperceive or justify poor decisions in international politics?

### Key Premises & Supporting Points
- Dissonance arises when new information conflicts with beliefs or past choices (e.g., sunk costs in policies).
- To reduce discomfort, people revise beliefs, reinterpret past decisions more favorably, or avoid dissonant information.
- This process encourages inertia and incrementalism ‚Äî each policy step becomes harder to reverse.

### Main Supporting Evidence
- Examples from foreign policy decisions where commitment increased after initial investments, not because new facts justified continuation, but to reduce dissonance (echoing ‚Äúsunk cost fallacy‚Äù logic).

### Identified Assumptions
- That psychological comfort often overrides rational reappraisal of facts.

### Potential Weakness / Critique
- While cognitive dissonance explains psychological consistency, it may underplay the genuine strategic or material incentives that also reinforce continued policies.

---

## üìñ Chapter 12: Minimizing Misperception (In Lieu of Conclusions)

### Identified Thesis
While misperception can never be eliminated in international politics, certain disciplined practices can reduce its likelihood or impact, fostering more self-aware decision-making.

### Central Question
What practical steps can decision-makers take to mitigate systematic perceptual errors?

### Key Prescriptions
- **Make assumptions explicit:** clearly state beliefs and expectations so they can be questioned.
- **Use devil‚Äôs advocates:** institutionalize challenge functions to disrupt [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink).
- **Consider alternative explanations deliberately:** try to view situations from others‚Äô perspectives.
- **Be wary of assuming** that others see situations as you do, or that your peaceful intentions are obvious.

### Supporting Points & Evidence
- Historical examples like Kissinger regretting insufficient thought on MIRV (multiple warhead) deployments illustrate missed opportunities for more reflective analysis.
- Jervis ties this to cognitive consistency from Chapter 4 ‚Äî by being explicit and self-critical, policymakers can force themselves to confront uncomfortable information.

### Identified Assumptions
- That better self-conscious judgment can partially counteract automatic perception biases.

### Potential Weakness
- As Jervis admits, no formula can ensure correct perceptions in ambiguous international environments ‚Äî the chapter acknowledges the limits of these remedies.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion on Chapters 11‚Äì12
- Chapter 11 adds cognitive dissonance as a final psychological mechanism explaining why policies persist despite failing assumptions, complementing prior chapters on consistency and wishful thinking.
- Chapter 12 serves as a modest, cautious guide to improving decision-making, showing Jervis‚Äôs ultimate realism: we can reduce, but never eliminate, dangerous misperceptions.
