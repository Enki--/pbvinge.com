# Future Reading List

This is my collection of books I plan to read. Each book is listed in the frontmatter above with its metadata.

## Why Keep a Future Reading List?

Maintaining a future reading list helps me:
1. Track interesting book recommendations
2. Organize my learning journey
3. Plan my reading schedule

## How to Add Books

To add a new book, simply add a new entry to the `books` array in the frontmatter following this template:

```yaml
  - title: "Book Title"
    author: "Author Name"
    class: "Category"
    dateCompleted: "TBR"
    coverImage: "path/to/cover.jpg"
    tags:
      - "Tag1"
      - "Tag2"
    reason: "Why you want to read this book"
```
