## Design Principles

1. **Content First**: All content is managed through Markdown files, making it easily editable and compatible with Obsidian for knowledge management.
2. **Academic Integration**: Built-in citation system supporting multiple formats (BibTeX, APA, MLA) for academic reference.
3. **Minimal & Clean**: Using Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design that puts content readability first.

## Content Structure

The site uses Astro's Content Collections to manage structured content:

- `src/content/books/` - Individual book notes with detailed metadata and citations
- `src/content/futureReads/` - Reading list managed through a single Markdown file
- `src/content/documents/` - Historic documents (primary sources) with minimal metadata

### Book Note Format

Book notes use frontmatter for metadata:

```yaml
---
tags: ["üìöBook"]
title: "Book Title"
subtitle: "Book Subtitle"  # Optional
author:
  - "Author Name"
category:
  - "Category"  # Optional
publisher: "Publisher Name"  # Optional
publish: YYYY-MM-DD  # Optional, date format
pages: 123  # Optional
isbn10: "1234567890"  # Optional
isbn13: "1234567890123"  # Optional
cover: "URL to cover image"
status: "to read" | "reading" | "complete"  # Optional
created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS  # Optional
updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS  # Optional
class: "Class/Category"  # Optional
sequence: "Sequence Info"  # Optional
---
```

### Future Reading List

Future reading list is managed in `src/content/futureReads/index.md` with the following structure:

```yaml
---
books:
  - title: "Book Title"
    author: "Author Name"
    class: "Category"
    dateCompleted: "TBR"
    coverImage: "path/to/cover.jpg"
    tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2"]
---
```

### Historic Documents

Historic documents live in `src/content/documents/` as individual Markdown files. The URL path is derived from the filename, e.g. `battle-of-britain.md` becomes `/historic-documents/battle-of-britain`.

Frontmatter example:

```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"          # Required
subtitle: "Optional subtitle"    # Optional
authors:                          # Optional array
  - "Author or Organization"
origin: "Country/Organization"    # Optional
date: 1943-06-15                  # Optional (YYYY-MM-DD)
tags: ["Historic", "Airpower"]    # Optional
cover: "/assets/documents/cover.png"  # Optional (under /public)
externalUrl: "https://source.example/doc.pdf" # Optional
isPublished: true                 # Defaults to true
---

Markdown body content here...
```

Routes:
- List page: `/historic-documents`
- Detail page: `/historic-documents/<slug>` (slug from filename)
