## Design Principles

1. **Content First**: All content is managed through Markdown files, making it easily editable and compatible with Obsidian for knowledge management.
2. **Academic Integration**: Built-in citation system supporting multiple formats (BibTeX, APA, MLA) for academic reference.
3. **Minimal & Clean**: Using Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design that puts content readability first.

## Content Structure

The site uses Astro's Content Collections to manage structured content:

- `src/content/books/` - Individual book notes with detailed metadata and citations
- `src/content/futureReads/` - Reading list managed through a single Markdown file

### Book Note Format

Book notes use frontmatter for metadata:

```yaml
---
tags: ["📚Book"]
title: "Book Title"
subtitle: "Book Subtitle"  # Optional
author:
  - "Author Name"
category:
  - "Category"  # Optional
publisher: "Publisher Name"  # Optional
publish: YYYY-MM-DD  # Optional, date format

created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS  # Optional
updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS  # Optional
class: "Class/Category"  # Optional
sequence: "Sequence Info"  # Optional
---
```

### Future Reading List

Future reading list is managed in `src/content/futureReads/index.md` with the following structure:

```yaml
---
books:
  - title: "Book Title"
    author: "Author Name"
    class: "Category"
    dateCompleted: "TBR"
    coverImage: "path/to/cover.jpg"
